 ~ <@752917145226313768> hey, love this idea!

You might have a better time creating a new `/chat` for each new paper - this chat is super long so the 'context' is muddied up with all th eprevious conversations. 

You will get cleaner and more consistent results if you pop a new chat and start fresh each time (and then maybe later, grabbing the summaries of a group of related papers and plop it into yet ANOTHER chat to discuss them collectively)

 This review analyzes the efficacy of non-pharmacological dietary supplementations in treating ADHD in children and adolescents, exploring various categories like PUFAs, amino acids, micronutrients, and probiotics. While methodologies vary and no definitive cognitive or behavioral improvements have been pinpointed, some symptomatology improvements with PUFAs and micronutrients were noted. Emerging fields like plant extracts and probiotics show promising preliminary results, indicating potential future support for standard ADHD treatments if further research confirms these findings.

 And this one: Abstract
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in children and adolescents, with environmental and biological causal influences. Pharmacological medication is the first choice in ADHD treatment; recently, many studies have concentrated on dietary supplementation approaches to address nutritional deficiencies, to which part of non-responses to medications have been imputed. This review aims to evaluate the efficacy of non-pharmacological supplementations in children or adolescents with ADHD. We reviewed 42 randomized controlled trials comprised of the following supplementation categories: polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), peptides and amino acids derivatives, single micronutrients, micronutrients mix, plant extracts and herbal supplementations, and probiotics. The reviewed studies applied heterogeneous methodologies, thus making it arduous to depict a systematic overview. No clear effect on single cognitive, affective, or behavioral domain was found for any supplementation category. Studies on PUFAs and micronutrients found symptomatology improvements. Peptides and amino acids derivatives, plant extracts, herbal supplementation, and probiotics represent innovative research fields and preliminary results may be promising. In conclusion, such findings, if confirmed through future research, should represent evidence for the efficacy of dietary supplementation as a support to standard pharmacological and psychological therapies in children and adolescents with ADHD.

 The systematic review suggests emerging, yet preliminary, evidence for the potential use of medicinal cannabis, particularly cannabidiol (CBD), in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, current data is insufficient to firmly recommend cannabinoid-based interventions for ADHD, and clinicians should exercise caution, considering safety and dosage factors, especially with high-dose THC formulas. Further research is needed to establish efficacy and safety profiles for the use of medicinal cannabis in ADHD treatment.

 The systematic review explores the potential application of medicinal cannabis in psychiatry, with preliminary evidence suggesting benefits, particularly for cannabidiol (CBD) in reducing social anxiety and as an adjunct in schizophrenia. However, the evidence is still emerging, and clinicians should consider various safety and prescriptive factors, particularly with high-dose THC formulas, before recommending cannabinoid-based treatments.

 And this one: Abstract
Background: Medicinal cannabis has received increased research attention over recent years due to loosening global regulatory changes. Medicinal cannabis has been reported to have potential efficacy in reducing pain, muscle spasticity, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and intractable childhood epilepsy. Yet its potential application in the field of psychiatry is lesser known.

Methods: The first clinically-focused systematic review on the emerging medical application of cannabis across all major psychiatric disorders was conducted. Current evidence regarding whole plant formulations and plant-derived cannabinoid isolates in mood, anxiety, sleep, psychotic disorders and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is discussed; while also detailing clinical prescription considerations (including pharmacogenomics), occupational and public health elements, and future research recommendations. The systematic review of the literature was conducted during 2019, assessing the data from all case studies and clinical trials involving medicinal cannabis or plant-derived isolates for all major psychiatric disorders (neurological conditions and pain were omitted).

Results: The present evidence in the emerging field of cannabinoid therapeutics in psychiatry is nascent, and thereby it is currently premature to recommend cannabinoid-based interventions. Isolated positive studies have, however, revealed tentative support for cannabinoids (namely cannabidiol; CBD) for reducing social anxiety; with mixed (mainly positive) evidence for adjunctive use in schizophrenia. 

Conclusions: There is currently encouraging, albeit embryonic, evidence for medicinal cannabis in the treatment of a range of psychiatric disorders. Supportive findings are emerging for some key isolates, however, clinicians need to be mindful of a range of prescriptive and occupational safety considerations, especially if initiating higher dose THC formulas.

 The meta-analysis assesses the efficacy and tolerability of ADHD medications, suggesting methylphenidate as the preferred option for children and adolescents and amphetamines for adults in short-term treatment. The study emphasizes the need for urgent research into the long-term effects of these drugs to inform patients, clinicians, and policymakers.

 And this one: Abstract
Background: The benefits and safety of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remain controversial, and guidelines are inconsistent on which medications are preferred across different age groups. We aimed to estimate the comparative efficacy and tolerability of oral medications for ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults.

Methods: We did a literature search for published and unpublished double-blind randomised controlled trials comparing amphetamines (including lisdexamfetamine), atomoxetine, bupropion, clonidine, guanfacine, methylphenidate, and modafinil with each other or placebo. We systematically contacted study authors and drug manufacturers for additional information. Primary outcomes were efficacy (change in severity of ADHD core symptoms based on teachers' and clinicians' ratings) and tolerability (proportion of patients who dropped out of studies because of side-effects) at timepoints closest to 12 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks. We estimated summary odds ratios (ORs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) using pairwise and network meta-analysis with random effects. We assessed the risk of bias of individual studies with the Cochrane risk of bias tool and confidence of estimates with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for network meta-analyses. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42014008976.

Interpretation: Our findings represent the most comprehensive available evidence base to inform patients, families, clinicians, guideline developers, and policymakers on the choice of ADHD medications across age groups. Taking into account both efficacy and safety, evidence from this meta-analysis supports methylphenidate in children and adolescents, and amphetamines in adults, as preferred first-choice medications for the short-term treatment of ADHD. New research should be funded urgently to assess long-term effects of these drugs.

 The study examines the use of melatonin in treating sleep disorders in children with ADHD, finding it generally effective and well-tolerated for chronic sleep onset insomnia. However, due to the lack of specific pediatric guidelines and limited research on the effects on puberty and the endocrine system, its use should be reserved for severe cases with clear circadian rhythm disruptions, and further safety research is necessary.

 And this one: Abstract
Background: Sleep disorders are common in children with ADHD and they are aggravated by treatment with stimulantia. We focus on treatment with melatonin and weigh up its efficacy and safety.

Aim: To consider the evidence supporting the use of melatonin in the treatment of children with ADHD and to assess the efficacy and safety of such treatment.

Method: We studied the literature using databases Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library and the search terms 'ADHD', â€˜melatonin', â€˜insomnia', â€˜methylphenidate', â€˜side-effects', â€˜endocrinology'.

Results: 25-50% of children with ADHD reported disturbed sleep patterns particularly in the form of (chronic) sleep onset insomnia ((C)SOI). Currently available research results indicate that melatonin can be effective in the treatment of (C)SOI and, on the whole, is well tolerated. However, there is a lack of pharmaceutical preparations of melatonin that give details about their use for children and that give evidence-based guidelines about the dosage and timing of intake. Very little systematic research has been done into the possible impact of melatonin intake on puberty and the endocrine system. Therefore, treatment with melatonin in children with ADHD and (C)SOI is best reserved for children with persistent insomnia which is having a severe impact on daily functioning, particularly in cases where is an obvious phase-shift of the endogenous circadian rhythm.

Conclusion: If indications are particularly strong there may be good reason to use melatonin to treat sleep disorders in children with ADHD. However, further research into the safety of melatonin is needed.

 This study investigates the druggable genome in ADHD using genome-wide association studies, revealing that current first-line ADHD medications may not target genes associated with the disorder. It identifies new potential drug targets within three genetic loci and suggests signal transduction and cell adhesion as novel treatment avenues, providing a framework for exploring the druggable genome and potentially leading to etiological interventions for ADHD.

 And this one: Abstract
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder with only symptomatic care available. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies can provide a starting point in the search for novel drug targets and possibilities of drug repurposing. Here, we explored the druggable genome in ADHD by utilising GWA studies on ADHD and its co-morbid conditions. First, we explored whether the genes targeted by current ADHD drugs show association with the disorder and/or its co-morbidities. Second, we aimed to identify genes and pathways involved in the biological processes underlying ADHD that can be targeted by pharmacological agents. These ADHD-associated druggable genes and pathways were also examined in co-morbidities of ADHD, as commonalities in their aetiology and management may lead to novel pharmacological insights. Strikingly, none of the genes encoding targets of first-line pharmacotherapeutics for ADHD were significantly associated with the disorder, suggesting that FDA-approved ADHD drugs may act through different mechanisms than those underlying ADHD. In the examined druggable genome, three loci on chromosomes 1, 4 and 12 revealed significant association with ADHD and contained nine druggable genes, five of which encode established drug targets for malignancies, autoimmune and neurodevelopmental disorders. To conclude, we present a framework to assess the druggable genome in a disorder, exemplified by ADHD. We highlight signal transduction and cell adhesion as potential novel avenues for ADHD treatment. Our findings add to knowledge on known ADHD drugs and present the exploration of druggable genome associated with ADHD, which may offer interventions at the aetiological level of the disorder.

 The review highlights advancements in ADHD treatment, focusing on the variety of new stimulant formulations and delivery systems for amphetamine and methylphenidate, which, along with a deeper understanding of individual responses, allows clinicians to more effectively tailor treatment plans for their patients, although the absence of reliable biomarkers for treatment response still poses a challenge.

 And this one: Abstract
In the last 15 years, there has been a marked increase in the number of available stimulant formulations with the emphasis on long-acting formulations, and the introduction of several novel delivery systems such as orally dissolving tablets, chewable tablets, extended-release liquid formulations, transdermal patches, and novel "beaded" technology. All of these formulations involve changes to the pharmaceutical delivery systems of the two existing compounds most commonly employed to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), amphetamine (AMP) and methylphenidate (MPH). In addition to these new formulations, our knowledge about the individual differences in response has advanced and contributes to a more nuanced approach to treatment. The clinician can now make increasingly informed choices about these formulations and more effectively individualize treatment in a way that had not been possible before. In the absence of reliable biomarkers that can predict individualized response to ADHD treatment, clinical knowledge about differences in MPH and AMP pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism can be utilized to personalize treatment and optimize response. Different properties of these new formulations (delivery modality, onset of action, duration of response, safety, and tolerability) will most likely weigh heavily into the clinician's choice of formulation. To manage the broad range of options that are now available, clinicians should familiarize themselves in each of these categories for both stimulant compounds. This review is meant to serve as an update and a guide to newer stimulant formulations and includes a brief review of ADHD and stimulant properties.

 This study on impulsive behavior in mice suggests that impulsive action and impulsive choice are separate behavioral constructs with different biological bases. Manipulation of serotonin 1B receptor expression increased impulsive action without affecting impulsive choice, and factor analysis confirmed these as distinct factors influenced by sex and receptor expression, which may inform better understanding and treatment of psychiatric disorders characterized by impulsivity.

 And this one: Abstract
Impulsivity is an endophenotype found in many psychiatric disorders including substance use disorders, pathological gambling, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Two behavioral features often considered in impulsive behavior are behavioral inhibition (impulsive action) and delayed gratification (impulsive choice). However, the extent to which these behavioral constructs represent distinct facets of behavior with discrete biological bases is unclear. To test the hypothesis that impulsive action and impulsive choice represent statistically independent behavioral constructs in mice, we collected behavioral measures of impulsivity in a single cohort of mice using well-validated operant behavioral paradigms. Mice with manipulation of serotonin 1B receptor (5-HT1BR) expression were included as a model of disordered impulsivity. A factor analysis was used to characterize correlations between the measures of impulsivity and to identify covariates. Using two approaches, we dissociated impulsive action from impulsive choice. First, the absence of 5-HT1BRs caused increased impulsive action, but not impulsive choice. Second, based on an exploratory factor analysis, a two-factor model described the data well, with measures of impulsive action and choice separating into two independent factors. A multiple-indicator multiple-causes analysis showed that 5-HT1BR expression and sex were significant covariates of impulsivity. Males displayed increased impulsivity in both dimensions, whereas 5-HT1BR expression was a predictor of increased impulsive action only. These data support the conclusion that impulsive action and impulsive choice are distinct behavioral phenotypes with dissociable biological influences that can be modeled in mice. Our work may help inform better classification, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric disorders, which present with disordered impulsivity.

 And this one: Abstract
CNS diseases, including psychiatric disorders, represent a significant opportunity for the discovery and development of new drugs and therapeutic treatments with the potential to have a significant impact on human health. CNS diseases, however, present particular challenges to therapeutic discovery efforts, and psychiatric diseases/disorders may be among the most difficult. With specific exceptions such as psychostimulants for ADHD, a large number of psychiatric patients are resistant to existing treatments. In addition, clinicians have no way of knowing which psychiatric patients will respond to which drugs. By definition, psychiatric diagnoses are syndromal in nature; determinations of efficacy are often self-reported, and drug discovery is largely model-based. While such models of psychiatric disease are amenable to screening for new drugs, whether cellular or whole-animal based, they have only modest face validity and, more importantly, predictive validity. Multiple academic, pharmaceutical industry, and government agencies are dedicated to the translation of new findings about the neurobiology of major psychiatric disorders into the discovery and advancement of novel therapies. The collaboration of these agencies provide a pathway for developing new therapeutics. These efforts will be greatly helped by recent advances in understanding the genetic bases of psychiatric disorders, the ongoing search for diagnostic and therapy-responsive biomarkers, and the validation of new animal models.

 This review proposes an integrative model explaining the high comorbidity between ADHD and smoking through shared dysregulations in dopaminergic and nicotinic-acetylcholinergic circuits, likely influenced by genetic variations affecting monoaminergic neurotransmission. It discusses how ADHD impacts smoking behavior, the neuropharmacological commonalities, and implications for prevention and treatment.

 And this one: Abstract
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and tobacco smoking are among the most common and costly psychiatric and behavioral problems. The rates of co-occurrence of these two common problems are larger than expected by chance. Despite progress in identifying the neural and genetic substrates of each, the mechanisms underlying the high rates of comorbidity between ADHD and smoking remain largely unknown. We propose that ADHD and smoking involve dysregulation of dopaminergic and nicotinic-acetylcholinergic circuits and that these aberrations are likely to arise, at least in part, from genetic variations. This review describes an integrative model of the ADHD-smoking comorbidity, with an emphasis on shared neuropharmacological mechanisms. We first describe the prevalence of smoking among ADHD patients. We then describe how ADHD influences stages of smoking behavior (e.g., initiation, maintenance, and relapse). We review common potential genetic substrates of ADHD and smoking, focusing on genes that regulate monoaminergic neurotransmission. We review the behavioral and neuropharmacological bases of smoking and ADHD, focusing on the modulatory roles of nicotine on attention and behavioral control. Finally, we discuss the implications of this model for prevention and clinical outcomes.

 And this one: Abstract
We conducted a cost analysis of the behavioral, pharmacological, and combined interventions employed in a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized, and adaptive trial investigating the sequencing and enhancement of treatment for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; Pelham et al., 201X; N = 146, 76% male, 80% Caucasian). The quantity of resources expended on each child's treatment was determined from records that listed the type, date, location, persons present, and duration of all services provided. The inputs considered were the amount of physician time, clinician time, paraprofessional time, teacher time, parent time, medication, and gasoline. Quantities of these inputs were converted into costs in 2013 USD using national wage estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the prices of 30-day supplies of prescription drugs from the national Express Scripts service, and mean fuel prices from the Energy Information Administration. Beginning treatment with a low-dose/intensity regimen of behavior modification (large-group parent training) was less costly for a school year of treatment ($961) than beginning treatment with a low dose of stimulant medication ($1,669), regardless of whether the initial treatment was intensified with a higher "dose" or if the other modality was added. Outcome data from the parent study (Pelham et al., 201X) found equivalent or superior outcomes for treatments beginning with low-intensity behavior modification compared to intervention beginning with medication. Combined with the present analyses, these findings suggest that initiating treatment with behavior modification rather than medication is the more cost-effective option for children with ADHD.

 And this one: Abstract
Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) mainly manifests as learning difficulties, emotional impulsiveness, excessive activities, and attention deficit disorder. Given that it can influence social communication abilities, as well as physical and psychological health and viability, ADHD rehabilitation has attracted close attention. This study aims to discuss the influences of musicotherapy combined with cognitive behavioral intervention on the cognitive ability of children with ADHD and provide some references for ADHD rehabilitation.

Subjects and methods: A total of 120 children with ADHD in the Cooperative Hospital of Guangzhou University from June 2018 to May 2021 were chosen as the research objects. They were divided randomly into the control and observation groups with 60 cases in each group via the observing random digital method. The control group was the blank control and did not receive any intervention. The observation group received 16 weeks of musicotherapy combined with cognitive behavioral intervention. Symptoms and the results of the numerical cross-attention test, the Wisconsin card sorting test, the combined Raven's test (CRT), the Wechsler intelligence scale for children test, and Conner's child behavioral scale for parents of the two groups before and after the intervention were compared.

Results: The relevant indexes of the control group did not show any significant changes after the intervention (P>0.05). In the intervention group, the accurately crossed number and net scores increased significantly, whereas the wrongly crossed number and missed crossed number scores and error; attention deficit; hyperactivity-impulsiveness; and ADHD-RS-â…£ total scores declined dramatically after intervention relative to those before the intervention.

 And this one: Abstract
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent and chronic mental health condition that often results in substantial impairments throughout life. Although evidence-based pharmacological and psychosocial treatments exist for ADHD, effects of these treatments are acute, do not typically generalize into non-treated settings, rarely sustain over time, and insufficiently affect key areas of functional impairment (i.e., family, social, and academic functioning) and executive functioning. The limitations of current evidence-based treatments may be due to the inability of these treatments to address underlying neurocognitive deficits that are related to the symptoms of ADHD and associated areas of functional impairment. Although efforts have been made to directly target the underlying neurocognitive deficits of ADHD, extant neurocognitive interventions have shown limited efficacy, possibly due to misspecification of training targets and inadequate potency. We argue herein that despite these limitations, next-generation neurocognitive training programs that more precisely and potently target neurocognitive deficits may lead to optimal outcomes when used in combination with specific skill-based psychosocial treatments for ADHD. We discuss the rationale for such a combined treatment approach, prominent examples of this combined treatment approach for other mental health disorders, and potential combined treatment approaches for pediatric ADHD. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research necessary to develop a combined neurocognitive + skill-based treatment for youth with ADHD.

 And this one: Abstract
The prevalence of psychiatric disorders permanently increases. Polyphenolic compounds can be involved in modulation of mental health including brain plasticity, behaviour, mood, depression, and cognition. In addition to their antioxidant ability other biomodulating properties have been observed. In the pathogenesis of depression disturbance in neurotransmitters, increased inflammatory processes, defects in neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and redox imbalance are observed. Ginkgo biloba, green tea, and Quercus robur extracts and curcumin can affect neuronal system in depressive patients. ADHD patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, especially stimulants, report significant adverse effects; therefore, an alternative treatment is searched for. An extract from Ginkgo biloba and from Pinus pinaster bark, Pycnogenol, could become promising complementary supplements in ADHD treatment. Schizophrenia is a devastating mental disorder, with oxidative stress involved in its pathophysiology. The direct interference of polyphenols with schizophrenia pathophysiology has not been reported yet. However, increased oxidative stress caused by haloperidol was inhibited ex vivo by different polyphenols. Curcumin, extract from green tea and from Ginkgo biloba, may have benefits on serious side effects associated with administration of neuroleptics to patients suffering from schizophrenia. Polyphenols in the diet have the potential to become medicaments in the field of mental health after a thorough study of their mechanism of action.

 And this one: Abstract
There is a substantial body of literature documenting the efficacy of multiple unrelated pharmacological agents in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) individuals throughout the life-cycle. The available literature indicates the important role of psychopharmacological agents in the reduction of the core symptoms of ADHD and associated impairments. The literature documents that stimulants not only improve abnormal behaviours of ADHD, but also improves self-esteem, cognition, and social and family function. However, response varied in different age groups and with certain comorbidities. In addition there is a large body of literature documenting the efficacy of atomoxetine which shows improvement in these same domains. More research is needed on alternative pharmacological treatments and to further evaluate established therapeutics beyond school-aged Caucasian boys. Further, more research is needed on the efficacy of treatment for comorbid ADHD, use of combined medications, and the combination of medication and psychosocial treatment.

 And this one: Abstract
Purpose of review: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a widely diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorder giving rise to symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattentiveness that can impair daily functioning. Stimulants, such as methylphenidate and amphetamines, are the mainstay of treatment for ADHD. However, nonstimulant drugs such as viloxazine, atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine are becoming more popular due to minimal adverse effects when compared to stimulants.

Recent findings: Viloxazine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) originally used to treat depression in adults with activity in both the noradrenergic as well as serotonergic pathways. Studies have demonstrated its efficacy for its use in the treatment of ADHD. Unlike stimulants, viloxazine has a decreased chance of substance abuse, drug dependance, and withdrawal symptoms upon the cessation of therapy. Additionally, dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens after treatment with viloxazine are elevated considerably less in comparison with traditional stimulant ADHD treatments. Viloxazine provides an alternative, nonstimulant approach to treating ADHD.

Summary: Viloxazine is a recently approved, non-stimulant medication functions by inhibiting the uptake of norepinephrine which has been seen to be decreased in patients with ADHD. When patients do not respond to first-line stimulants, cannot tolerate the side effects, or have contraindications to stimulants, viloxazine may be a nonstimulant option offering patients an increasing arsenal of medications to treat ADHD.

 And this one: Abstract
Background: Adverse-event reports from North America have raised concern that the use of drugs for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study with automated data from four health plans (Tennessee Medicaid, Washington State Medicaid, Kaiser Permanente California, and OptumInsight Epidemiology), with 1,200,438 children and young adults between the ages of 2 and 24 years and 2,579,104 person-years of follow-up, including 373,667 person-years of current use of ADHD drugs. We identified serious cardiovascular events (sudden cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke) from health-plan data and vital records, with end points validated by medical-record review. We estimated the relative risk of end points among current users, as compared with nonusers, with hazard ratios from Cox regression models.

Results: Cohort members had 81 serious cardiovascular events (3.1 per 100,000 person-years). Current users of ADHD drugs were not at increased risk for serious cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31 to 1.85). Risk was not increased for any of the individual end points, or for current users as compared with former users (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.72). Alternative analyses addressing several study assumptions also showed no significant association between the use of an ADHD drug and the risk of a study end point.

Conclusions: This large study showed no evidence that current use of an ADHD drug was associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events, although the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval indicated that a doubling of the risk could not be ruled out. However, the absolute magnitude of such an increased risk would be low. (Funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Food and Drug Administration.).

 And this one: Abstract
Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the effect of music therapy as an alternative treatment on depression in children and adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) by activating serotonin (5-HT) and improving stress coping ability.

Methods: This study is designed based on randomization method. A total of 36 subjects participated in the experiment, consisting of an ADHD control group (n = 18) and ADHD music therapy group (n = 18). The ADHD control group received standard care, while the ADHD music therapy group received music therapy and standard care. The ADHD music therapy group received both active music therapy (improvisation) and receptive music therapy (music listening) for 50 minutes, twice a week, for 3 months: a total of 24 times. From a neurophysiological perspective, changes in depression and stress were tracked by measuring 5-HT secretion, cortisol expression, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and CDI and DHQ psychological scales.

Results: The ADHD music therapy group's 5-HT secretion increased (p < 0.001), whereas cortisol expression (p < 0.001), BP (p < 0.001) and HR (p < 0.001) decreased. The CDI and DHQ psychological scales also showed positive changes (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). However, the ADHD Con G's (who did not receive music therapy) 5-HT secretion did not increase, whereas cortisol expression, BP, and HR did not decrease. In addition, the CDI and DHQ psychological scales did not display positive changes.

Conclusions: In conclusion, the application of music therapy as an alternative treatment for ADHD children and adolescents showed positive neurophysiological and psychological effects. Therefore, this study would like to propose a new alternative to medicine for preventing and treating depression through various uses of music therapy.

 And this one: Abstract
Introduction: Childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is associated with impairment across multiple domains, including social, familial, emotional and academic functioning. Available therapies, and in particular medical treatment, fail to produce improvement in this impairment. In this context, interest has grown in physical activity and exercise as potential interventions for the treatment of children with ADHD.

Aim: The present study investigates the effect of a recreational swimming program on cognitives functions on Tunisian children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Methods: The study recruited school children aged 9 to 12 years (n total = 40) with diagnosis of ADHD. They were randomly assigned into exercise or control groups. Neuropsychological tasks; the complex figure of Rey (ROCF), the stroop test and the Hayling test were assessed before and after the exercise program.

Results: The results indicates that there were significant improvements in memory accuracy (p=0,000), selective attention (p=0,000), and inhibition process (p=0,000), in experimental group compared with the control group after the intervention. In the post-program, children experienced an overall shortening of task execution times with fewer errors of omissions. They also made fewer errors in interference situations, signaling better cognitive functioning. Conclusion These findings suggest that a recreational swimming program may have positive implications for cognitive function and may provide preliminary support for alternative therapeutic interventions that can be used by researchers, parents, educators, and clinicians and they support that reinforcement approved by recreational program can normalize cognitive deficiencies in children with ADHD.

 The study found that behavioral therapy, alone or with stimulants, as well as stimulants and non-stimulants, were more effective than placebo for ADHD. Combination therapy showed the highest efficacy and acceptability, with methylphenidate and amphetamine being the most effective medications. Despite associated side effects like anorexia and insomnia, no increase in serious adverse events was observed. However, the lack of high-quality evidence for many treatments necessitates caution in interpretation and an urgent call for more rigorous trials.

 Include this:  At the class level, behavioural therapy (alone or in combination with stimulants), stimulants, and non-stimulant seemed significantly more efficacious than placebo. Behavioural therapy in combination with stimulants seemed superior to stimulants or non-stimulants. Stimulants seemed superior to behavioural therapy, cognitive training and non-stimulants. Behavioural therapy, stimulants and their combination showed the best profile of acceptability. Stimulants and non-stimulants seemed well tolerated. Among medications, methylphenidate, amphetamine, atomoxetine, guanfacine and clonidine seemed significantly more efficacious than placebo. Methylphenidate and amphetamine seemed more efficacious than atomoxetine and guanfacine. Methylphenidate and clonidine seemed better accepted than placebo and atomoxetine. Most of the efficacious pharmacological treatments were associated with harms (anorexia, weight loss and insomnia), but an increased risk of serious adverse events was not observed. There is lack of evidence for cognitive training, neurofeedback, antidepressants, antipsychotics, dietary therapy, fatty acids, and other complementary and alternative medicine. Overall findings were limited by the clinical and methodological heterogeneity, small sample sizes of trials, short-term follow-up, and the absence of high-quality evidence; consequently, results should be interpreted with caution.

Conclusions: Clinical differences may exist between the pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment used for the management of ADHD. Uncertainties about therapies and the balance between benefits, costs and potential harms should be considered before starting treatment. There is an urgent need for high-quality randomised trials of the multiple treatments for ADHD in children and adolescents. PROSPERO, number CRD42014015008.

 Abstract
Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorders in childhood. A wide variety of treatments have been used for the management of ADHD. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of pharmacological, psychological and complementary and alternative medicine interventions for the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents.

Methods and findings: We performed a systematic review with network meta-analyses. Randomised controlled trials (â‰¥ 3 weeks follow-up) were identified from published and unpublished sources through searches in PubMed and the Cochrane Library (up to April 7, 2016). Interventions of interest were pharmacological (stimulants, non-stimulants, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and other unlicensed drugs), psychological (behavioural, cognitive training and neurofeedback) and complementary and alternative medicine (dietary therapy, fatty acids, amino acids, minerals, herbal therapy, homeopathy, and physical activity). The primary outcomes were efficacy (treatment response) and acceptability (all-cause discontinuation). Secondary outcomes included discontinuation due to adverse events (tolerability), as well as serious adverse events and specific adverse events. Random-effects Bayesian network meta-analyses were conducted to obtain estimates as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% credibility intervals.

 And this one: Abstract
Background The international prevalence of adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is estimated at 2.5%. ADHD is associated with serious impairment in academic, occupational, social and emotional functioning. Despite the debilitating nature of this disorder, few individuals with ADHD receive appropriate help. Further, although psychopharmacology is considered the first-line treatment of adults with ADHD, it is now recognized that medication alone may be insufficient. Thus, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a promising approach.Objectives This study aimed to review literature and investigate the efficacy of CBT, in reducing ADHD symptoms and comorbid conditions such anxiety and depression for adults with ADHD, by several studies through a meta-analysis.Methods We searched the literature from 1946 through 2015 using especially MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO. We used a random-effects model, Odds Ratios (OR) and Hedge's g.Results Data from 12 randomized controlled studies were included, totaling 575 subjects. The results showed a significant reduction in ADHD symptoms (Hedge's g = 0.95) and comorbid anxiety (Hedge's g = 0.39) and depression (Hedge's g = 0.30) for the CBT group in comparison with controls. Following the end of treatment, ADHD symptoms continue to improve, but not the comorbid conditions.Conclusion In summary, in adults with ADHD, CBT appears to be a promising treatment.

 And this one: ABSTRACT
In todayâ€™s changing medical climate, physicians need to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) better and more cost-effectively. The authors review recommendations supported by recent research and offer simple practices that integrate medicine and behavioral health for patients with ADHD.

KEY POINTS
Despite concerns about overdiagnosis and overtreatment, many children and youth diagnosed with ADHD still receive no treatment or insufficient treatment.

Today, more children are prescribed drug therapy when ADHD is diagnosed, but the initial titration of medication is often done without sufficient physician supervision.

ADHD symptoms improve with drug therapy, but improvement is inconsistently sustained due to poor treatment adherence.

Drug therapy and behavioral therapy work together. Outcomes can be determined by measuring both improved behaviors and reduced symptoms.

Pharmacotherapy and behavioral therapy are currently used with success in treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, adolescents, and adults. Ongoing changes in healthcare require physicians to improve the quality of care, reduce costs of treatment, and manage their patientsâ€™ health, not just their illnesses. Behavioral and pharmacologic studies provide us with an opportunity to maximize treatment of ADHD and adapt it to the needs of individuals.

This article identifies common problems in treating ADHD, discusses limits of care in pharmacotherapy and behavioral intervention, and offers practical recommendations for treating ADHD in the changing world of healthcare.
