 Absolutely, discussing combined treatments could be a valuable part of this section. You might want to explore:

- How alternative treatments can complement traditional medication regimens.
- The potential for improved outcomes with a multi-modal approach.
- Studies or cases where a combination of treatments has been used successfully.
- The synergy between different treatment modalities and their mechanisms.

Including combined treatments would provide a comprehensive view of the alternative treatment landscape for ADHD.
