 Targeting malaria is a significant and impactful area of study. Using gene editing for insect control, particularly in mosquitos that transmit malaria, could be a fascinating capstone project. Here's how we might start narrowing down this topic:

### Potential Focus Areas:
- **Mosquito Species:** Focus on species like *Anopheles* that are known vectors of malaria.
- **Gene Editing Techniques:** Explore CRISPR or other gene-editing tools for mosquito population control.
- **Impact Assessment:** Study the potential ecological and health impacts of gene-edited mosquitos.

### Next Steps:
- **Literature Review:** Look at existing research on gene editing in mosquitos.
- **Objective Setting:** Define what you wish to achieve—e.g., reducing malaria transmission rates.
- **Methodology:** Determine how you will approach the gene editing aspect—lab work, simulations, etc.

Does this help narrow things down for you? Would you like to focus on one of these areas, or is there another direction you're considering?

 maybe we can target malaria

 Great, gene editing and insect control are more focused areas to explore. We can look into specific techniques, like CRISPR, and their applications in controlling pest populations or disease vectors. Are you thinking of targeting a particular pest or disease, or are you more interested in the methodology itself?

 maybe gene editing and insesct control

 It's quite common to start with a broad idea and then refine it as you delve deeper into the subject. Let's discuss which aspects of gene therapy and insects you find most intriguing, and we can work together to narrow down your topic to something more specific and manageable. What are some key points you're interested in exploring within this domain?
