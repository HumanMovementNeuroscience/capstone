 Insects that can help lower mosquito populations include:

- **Dragonflies:** Their larvae, known as nymphs, eat mosquito larvae, while adult dragonflies prey on adult mosquitoes.
- **Damselflies:** Similar to dragonflies, both the nymph stage and the adult stage of damselflies feed on mosquitoes.
- **Predaceous mosquitoes:** Some mosquito species, like those from the genus Toxorhynchites, have larvae that are predators to other mosquito larvae.
- **Ladybugs:** While they are more commonly known for eating aphids, they can consume mosquito eggs and larvae if present.
- **Aquatic beetles:** Many species of aquatic beetles and their larvae will eat mosquito larvae.
- **Backswimmers and Water Boatmen:** These aquatic insects are predators and will consume mosquito larvae.

Implementing these insects into environments plagued by mosquitoes can be part of an integrated pest management strategy to naturally reduce mosquito populations without relying solely on chemical means.
