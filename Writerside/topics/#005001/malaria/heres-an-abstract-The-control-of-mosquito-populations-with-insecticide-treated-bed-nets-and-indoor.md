 Thank you for sharing your abstract. It offers an insightful glimpse into a potential strategy for combating malaria transmission. Utilizing compounds that target steroid hormone signaling in Anopheles gambiae is certainly an innovative approach to address the growing concern of insecticide resistance. 

From a project management perspective, we could explore several avenues:

- Research and Design: Investigate the current state of knowledge on 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and its impact on mosquito physiology and behavior.
- Experimentation: Develop a plan to test the efficacy of 20E agonists in a controlled environment.
- Modeling: Utilize computational models to predict the impact of 20E agonist treatment on mosquito populations and malaria transmission rates.
- Implementation Strategy: Consider the practical aspects of deploying this strategy in affected regions, including delivery mechanisms, safety, and cost-effectiveness.

This project certainly aligns with the innovative nature of a capstone project and has the potential to contribute significantly to the field. What are your thoughts on the next steps, or is there a particular aspect you're eager to delve into first?

> heres an abstract: The control of mosquito populations with insecticide treated bed nets and indoor residual sprays remains the cornerstone of malaria reduction and elimination programs. In light of widespread insecticide resistance in mosquitoes, however, alternative strategies for reducing transmission by the mosquito vector are urgently needed, including the identification of safe compounds that affect vectorial capacity via mechanisms that differ from fast-acting insecticides. Here, we show that compounds targeting steroid hormone signaling disrupt multiple biological processes that are key to the ability of mosquitoes to transmit malaria. When an agonist of the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) is applied to Anopheles gambiae females, which are the dominant malaria mosquito vector in Sub Saharan Africa, it substantially shortens lifespan, prevents insemination and egg production, and significantly blocks Plasmodium falciparum development, three components that are crucial to malaria transmission. Modeling the impact of these effects on Anopheles population dynamics and Plasmodium transmission predicts that disrupting steroid hormone signaling using 20E agonists would affect malaria transmission to a similar extent as insecticides. Manipulating 20E pathways therefore provides a powerful new approach to tackle malaria transmission by the mosquito vector, particularly in areas affected by the spread of insecticide resistance.
