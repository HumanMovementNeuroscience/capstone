 The study by Lewis and Tumlinson reveals that parasitic wasps can learn to associate new odors with their hosts using chemical cues from host faeces, an adaptation that could be leveraged for developing biological pest control methods in agriculture.

 This 1988 article by Lewis and Tumlinson presents fascinating insights into the behavior of parasitic wasps, specifically Microplitis croceipes, and their ability to locate hosts using chemical cues. The study demonstrates that these wasps can learn and remember associations between specific odors and the presence of their host, allowing them to improve their hunting efficiency. This associative learning is particularly interesting as it suggests that wasps can adapt to recognize new and otherwise neutral odors, like vanilla, when these are associated with host faeces.

From a capstone project perspective, this could open up several avenues for exploration:

- The potential for using parasitoid wasps in biological control methods within agriculture, targeting pests that damage crops.
- Investigating the feasibility of genetically editing parasitoid wasps to enhance their host-seeking abilities or to target specific pests more effectively.
- Exploring the use of similar associative learning in other pest control methods, perhaps incorporating gene editing techniques like CRISPR to create more efficient pest control organisms.

Would you like to dive deeper into the implications of this study for your project or discuss how you can incorporate these findings into your research?

> talk about this article: Lewis, W., Tumlinson, J. Host detection by chemically mediated associative learning in a parasitic wasp. Nature 331, 257–259 (1988). https://doi.org/10.1038/331257a0Parasitic insects use chemical cues to locate their hosts, and prior experiences can modify their responses to these odours1–4. Females of the parasitic wasp Microplitis croceipes experienced by contact with host faeces, orient and fly upwind to odours from their hosts, larvae of the moth Heliothis zea5. We use flight tunnel studies to show that associative learning occurs during encounters with host faeces. When females touch the faeces with their antennae they learn to recognize and subsequently fly to various volatile odours, even novel and otherwise unattractive odours like vanilla, associated with the faeces. They link these volatile odours with a water extractable nonvolatile chemical in the faeces, evidently a host-specific recognition cue. The association of tracking cues with host by-products, without the need for direct contact with the host, is a valuable adaptation for locating cryptic and evasive hosts.
