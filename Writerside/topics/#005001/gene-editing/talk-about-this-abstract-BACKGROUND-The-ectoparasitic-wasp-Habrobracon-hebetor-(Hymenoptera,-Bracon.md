 The study demonstrates the successful application of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in the parasitic wasp Habrobracon hebetor, achieving inheritable mutations without impacting the wasp's vital biological functions, and introduces a non-invasive method for monitoring these genetic changes using DNA from cocoons. This advancement offers potential for enhanced biological control of pest populations in agriculture.

 Certainly! Extending the use of gene-edited wasps like H. hebetor to control other pest populations involves several potential strategies:

1. **Host Specificity Alteration**:
   - Gene editing can potentially alter the host specificity of the wasp to target different pest species that are problematic in agriculture or carry diseases.

2. **Efficiency Enhancement**:
   - By enhancing traits that make the wasps more efficient parasites, such as improving their ability to locate and parasitize hosts, we can increase their impact on controlling specific pest populations.

3. **Resistance Management**:
   - Gene editing could be used to circumvent resistance mechanisms in pests, ensuring that the wasps remain effective biological control agents over time.

4. **Pest Behavior Modification**:
   - Targeting genes that influence pest behavior can make them more susceptible to parasitization, thereby enhancing control efforts.

5. **Disease Vector Control**:
   - In the context of diseases like malaria, wasps could be engineered to target and suppress populations of disease vectors, such as mosquitoes.

These approaches could be incorporated into your capstone project as innovative methods of pest and disease vector control using gene editing in wasps. If you're interested, we can explore these concepts further and brainstorm how they might be applied in the real world.

 well no, talk about how this could be extended for the use of wasps to control OTHER populations

 The research on gene editing in Habrobracon hebetor can be applied to host population control in several ways:

1. **Targeted Gene Disruption**:
   - By disrupting genes essential for the host's survival or reproduction through CRISPR, the wasp population could be controlled.
   
2. **Inherited Sterility**:
   - Introducing sterility in a controlled portion of the population could reduce the number of offspring and manage population size over time.
   
3. **Biological Control Agents**:
   - H. hebetor could be engineered to be more effective against specific pests in agriculture, potentially reducing the need for chemical pesticides.

4. **Non-Invasive Monitoring**:
   - The method of using cocoon DNA for genotyping allows for ongoing monitoring of the engineered traits in the population without harming the wasps.

As you refine your capstone project, consider how these applications might align with your goals and interests in gene editing and insect use in disease and pest control. Would you like to delve deeper into any of these applications or discuss how to structure your project around them?

 This abstract presents an interesting study on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in the ectoparasitic wasp Habrobracon hebetor. It appears that the researchers have successfully utilized this technology to induce a specific mutation, observed as a loss of eye pigment, which is inheritable and does not negatively impact the wasp's biological parameters, except for a change in the offspring female rate and adult longevity. The use of cocoons for non-invasive genomic DNA extraction is a valuable method for genotype assessment. This research potentially opens up new avenues for enhancing the use of H. hebetor in biological control programs. 

Would you like to discuss any specific aspect of this abstract in relation to your capstone project?

> talk about this abstract: BACKGROUND The ectoparasitic wasp Habrobracon hebetor (Hymenoptera, Braconidae) can parasitize various species of lepidopteran pests. To maximize its potential for biological control, it is necessary to investigate its gene function through genome engineering.  RESULTS To test the effectiveness of genome engineering system in H. hebetor, we injected the mixture of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) -associated (Cas) 9 protein and single guide RNA(s) targeting gene white into embryos. The resulting mutants display a phenotype of eye pigment loss. The phenotype was caused by small indel and is heritable. Then, we compared some biological parameters between wildtype and mutant, and found there were no significant differences in other parameters except for the offspring female rate and adult longevity. In addition, cocoons could be used to extract genomic DNA for genotype during the gene editing process without causing unnecessary harm to H. hebetor.  CONCLUSION Our results demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be used for H. hebetor genome editing and it does not adversely affect biological parameters of the parasitoid wasps. We also provide a feasible non-invasive genotype detection method using genomic DNA extracted from cocoons. Our study introduces a novel tool and method for studying gene function in H. hebetor, and may contribute to better application of H. hebetor in biocontrol. Â© 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.
