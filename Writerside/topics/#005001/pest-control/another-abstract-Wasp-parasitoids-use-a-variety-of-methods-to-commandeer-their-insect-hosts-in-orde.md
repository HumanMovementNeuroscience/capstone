 The abstract describes how wasp parasitoids manipulate their insect hosts through substances like polydnaviruses and venom to create a conducive environment for their own development, often leading to the host's death. This manipulation opens up possibilities for developing new, environmentally safe insect control agents.

 Exploring the use of gene-edited parasitoid wasps for pest control offers an innovative solution to agricultural diseases and mosquito-borne illnesses, with considerations for environmental impact, ethical implications, effectiveness, and public perception. This research could lead to environmentally safe insect control agents utilizing regulatory molecules from parasitoids.

 That's an intriguing abstract focusing on the complex interactions between parasitoid wasps and their insect hosts. The use of wasp parasitoids in pest control, particularly in the context of gene editing, could be an innovative approach to addressing agricultural diseases and mosquito-borne illnesses. Here are a few considerations as you continue to refine your topic:

- **Environmental Impact**: Assessing the potential ecological consequences of introducing gene-edited parasitoids into the environment.
  
- **Ethical Considerations**: Considering the ethical implications of manipulating the genetics of organisms for pest control.

- **Effectiveness**: Evaluating how effective these gene-edited wasps might be in controlling target populations without affecting non-target species.

- **Public Perception**: Understanding and addressing public concerns about the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the environment.

As you delve into this topic, keep these aspects in mind. They can help shape your research and the direction of your capstone project. If you need resources, guidance on research methods, or assistance in any other aspect, feel free to ask.

> another abstract: Wasp parasitoids use a variety of methods to commandeer their insect hosts in order to create an environment that will support and promote their own development, usually to the detriment of the host insect. Parasitized insects typically undergo developmental arrest and die sometime after the parasitoid has become independent of its host. Parasitoids can deactivate their host's immune system and effect changes in host hormone titers and behavior. Often, host tissues or organs become refractory to stimulation by tropic hormones. Here we present an overview of the manipulative capabilities of wasp-injected calyx fluid containing polydnaviruses and venom, as well as the parasitoid larva and the teratocytes that originate from the serosal membrane that surrounds the developing embryo of the parasitoid. Possibilities for using regulatory molecules produced by the parasitoid or its products that would be potentially useful in developing new, environmentally safe insect control agents are discussed.
