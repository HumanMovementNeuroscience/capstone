 I don't have real-time access to databases, but generally, current trials for multiple myeloma are focusing on novel drug combinations, immunotherapies, and targeted treatments. It's a dynamic field with ongoing advancements. I recommend checking ClinicalTrials.gov for the latest information on specific trials and treatments. You can search by condition, drug, sponsor, and other criteria.

 That's a thoughtful place to start. Investigating the current landscape of clinical trials and treatments can give you a better understanding of where your project might fit. You can look into databases like ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials and the FDA website for recently approved treatments. Would you like some guidance on how to navigate these resources?
