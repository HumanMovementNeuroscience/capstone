 Certainly! Your capstone project now includes a focus on enhancing the interpretability of machine learning models in medical settings, specifically examining Random Forests and Logistic Regression due to their prevalent use in multiple myeloma prognosis. The goal is to improve their clarity for clinical application.

 You might consider exploring:
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Logistic Regression
- Bayesian Networks
- Neural Networks with Attention Mechanisms
- Rule-based Models

Each has its own strengths in terms of interpretability and accuracy in medical contexts.
