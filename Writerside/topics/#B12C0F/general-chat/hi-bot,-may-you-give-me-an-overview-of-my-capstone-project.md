 That sounds like a compelling hypothesis with significant implications for understanding the pathogenesis of T1D. I'm looking forward to helping you develop this aspect of your research. If you have any questions or need assistance as you progress, don't hesitate to reach out. Goodbye, and best of luck with your research! ðŸŒŸâœ¨

 That is exactly what I am trying to test! I hypothesize that the highest risk HLA alleles are binding incorrectly with diabetogenic peptides and resulting in errors in the negative selection of self reactive diabetogenic t-cells. I look forward to discussing this further with you. Goodbye!

 You haven't brought up negative selection so far. However, negative selection is a crucial process in the development of T cells, where cells that are strongly self-reactive are typically eliminated to prevent autoimmune diseases. In the context of your research question, you could explore the hypothesis that certain HLA alleles might be altering the process of negative selection, allowing self-reactive T cells that target islet antigens to survive, thus contributing to the development of Type 1 diabetes. This could be an interesting angle to investigate in your project.

 yes good point, have I mentioned negative selection yet? How may that play a role in my research question?

 No, you haven't mentioned any specific HLA alleles in our discussions yet. When you're ready to delve into that level of detail, I can help you organize and structure that aspect of your research proposal. It could be beneficial to identify and focus on the alleles that are most commonly associated with T1D in existing literature to form the basis of your study.

 Thank you bot, that is pretty accurate. I don't remember, did I mention any specific HLA alleles?

 Certainly!

### Capstone Project Overview
Your project is focused on researching the relationship between HLA alleles and the development of Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Here are the key aspects of your project:
- **Research Proposal**: You'll be crafting a detailed proposal for studying the interaction between HLA alleles and islet antigens.
- **HLA Alleles and T1D**: Investigating the prevalence of specific HLA alleles in T1D patients to understand their role in autoimmune destruction of islet beta cells.
- **Self-Reactive T Cells**: Exploring how these interactions may lead to the development of self-reactive T cells, contributing to the autoimmune nature of T1D.

Your project aims to contribute to the understanding of T1D's etiology, which could have implications for treatment and prevention strategies.
