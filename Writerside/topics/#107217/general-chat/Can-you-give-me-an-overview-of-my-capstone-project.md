 In that case, you can focus on a comprehensive literature review and data analysis. Hereâ€™s how you can structure your paper:

## Introduction
- Introduce the research topic and its importance.
- Outline the aims of your paper.

## Background
- Provide a detailed background on arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.
- Describe the normal functions and significance of PKP2, MYH7, and MYBPC3 genes.

## Literature Review
- Critically review existing research on the genetic mutations of these genes.
- Discuss their association with the disease based on the literature.

## Data Analysis
- Explain your approach to analyzing existing data.
- Present patterns, correlations, or insights you've found relevant to the mutations.

## Discussion
- Interpret the findings from the literature and data analysis.
- Discuss the implications for understanding or treating the disease.

## Conclusion
- Summarize the main findings.
- Highlight the relevance of your research and suggest areas for future study.

## References
- List all the scholarly sources you used.

 Of course! Your capstone project focuses on exploring the genetic mutations responsible for arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. You'll delve into the specific genes like PKP2, MYH7, and MYBPC3, to understand how their mutations contribute to the disease. Your work will involve a combination of literature review, data analysis, and potentially experimental research to draw meaningful conclusions about these genetic factors.
