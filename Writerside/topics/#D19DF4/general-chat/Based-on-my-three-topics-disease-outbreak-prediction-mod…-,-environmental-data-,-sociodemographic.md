 Utilizing patient stories and experiences as qualitative data can fit quite well into your existing outline. It aligns most closely with the "Sociodemographic Data Utilization" section but also adds depth to the "Disease Outbreak Prediction Models" section. Here's how it might integrate:

### Disease Outbreak Prediction Models
- **Incorporating Qualitative Data:** Exploring how patient narratives can be quantified and used to enhance AI and machine learning models for disease outbreak predictions.

### Sociodemographic Data Utilization
- **Qualitative Analysis:** Examining how patient stories and sociodemographic experiences provide context to data points and influence disease spread and outbreak patterns.
