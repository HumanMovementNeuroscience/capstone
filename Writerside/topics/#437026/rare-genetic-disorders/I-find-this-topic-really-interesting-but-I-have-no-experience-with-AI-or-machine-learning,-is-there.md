 Absolutely, you can certainly approach the topic from a biological or medical perspective. Here's how you might go about it:

- **Literature Review**: Start by reviewing existing literature on rare genetic disorders, gene therapies, and diagnostic techniques to get a foundational understanding of the current state of research.
- **Identify Gaps**: Look for gaps in the current research where you could contribute new insights or perspectives.
- **Expert Interviews**: Consider conducting interviews with experts in the field to gain deeper insights and perhaps identify potential collaboration opportunities.
- **Case Studies**: You could also focus on case studies of specific genetic disorders to explore their complexities in more depth.
- **Biomarker Identification**: Explore the biological markers associated with genetic disorders and their potential for diagnosis and treatment.
- **Policy Analysis**: Assess the impact of current policies on the research, treatment, and management of rare genetic disorders.

This can all be done without the need for AI or machine learning skills. However, if you're interested, there are many resources available to help you begin learning about AI in a biomedical context. Would you like to explore that as well?
