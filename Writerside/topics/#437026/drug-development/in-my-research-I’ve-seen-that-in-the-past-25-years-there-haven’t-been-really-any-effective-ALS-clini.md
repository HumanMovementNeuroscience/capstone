 Your project idea is ambitious and holds great potential. Here's how you might approach it:

### Feasibility Assessment
- **Scope**: Define a clear scope to keep the project manageable. Focus on specific biomarkers or genes.
- **Collaborations**: Consider partnering with students or mentors with AI expertise.

### Project Planning
- **Learning AI Basics**: Dedicate initial phase to understanding AI principles relevant to your project.
- **Data Access**: Secure access to genetic databases and understand their structure and content.
- **Tool Selection**: Identify AI tools and resources that are user-friendly and well-documented for beginners.

### Project Execution
- **Iterative Process**: Start with small, manageable experiments before scaling up.
- **Mentorship**: Regularly consult with AI and drug discovery mentors for guidance.
- **Documentation**: Keep detailed records of your process, challenges, and insights.

### Communication
- **Present Findings Clearly**: Focus on explaining your methods and results in an accessible way.
- **Feedback Loops**: Engage with peers and instructors to refine your approach based on feedback.

With a structured plan, enthusiasm, and the right support, your project is certainly feasible. Remember, the goal of the capstone is as much about the learning process as it is about the end result.

 For my project i think id like to look at specific bio markers and known target genes for als therapeutics, with an added perspective of how AI can help find new potential therapeutics and/or use a database of genetic testing to determine other potential targets. Does this seem doable with a limited background in AI and drug discovery

 The challenge with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) and similar rare genetic disorders is multifaceted:

### Scientific Complexity
- **Unknown Etiology**: The exact causes of ALS are not fully understood, which complicates the development of targeted therapies.
- **Genetic Diversity**: There's significant genetic variation among ALS patients, making it difficult to create a one-size-fits-all treatment.

### Clinical Challenges
- **Disease Progression**: ALS progresses quickly, and this rapid progression can outpace the timelines needed for clinical trial design, approval, and execution.
- **Small Patient Populations**: Rare disorders have fewer patients to participate in trials, which can limit the statistical power of the studies.

### Developmental Hurdles
- **Funding Limitations**: Research and development for rare diseases often have less financial support compared to more common conditions.
- **Regulatory Barriers**: Navigating the regulatory environment can be complex, and for rare diseases, the pathways may not be as well established.

### Therapeutic Limitations
- **Limited Biomarkers**: Lack of biomarkers for ALS makes it challenging to measure the efficacy of potential drugs in clinical trials.
- **Complex Drug Design**: Targeting the nervous system and crossing the blood-brain barrier adds another layer of complexity to drug development.

Understanding these challenges can help inform your project direction, potentially focusing on novel therapeutic targets, drug delivery systems, or even the clinical trial process itself for ALS.
