 Absolutely, conducting a thorough literature review is a critical step to understand the current research landscape. Here's a plan to get started:

### Literature Review Plan:

1. **Define Key Terms**:
   - List out keywords like "immunotherapy for ALS," "genetic therapies for ALS," "ALS diagnosis," and any other relevant terms.

2. **Search Databases**:
   - Use academic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, or Web of Science to find relevant articles.
   - Consider including review articles since they summarize current research.

3. **Organize Findings**:
   - Create a database or spreadsheet to track your findings.
   - Include citation information, key findings, methods, and gaps identified.

4. **Analyze Trends**:
   - Look for patterns in the research. What areas are well-studied? Where are the gaps?
   - Consider the dates of publication to determine the most recent findings.

5. **Evaluate Promising Research**:
   - Focus on studies that show promise or novel approaches.
   - Look for repeated mentions of specific therapies or diagnostic tools.

6. **Identify Gaps**:
   - Pay attention to what researchers identify as limitations or areas needing further study.

7. **Consult Experts**:
   - Reach out to professors or experts in the field for their opinions on promising research areas.

8. **Reflect on Findings**:
   - Consider how the existing research aligns with your interests and the scope of your project.

9. **Narrow Focus**:
   - Based on your findings, decide on a specific direction for your project that seems promising and under-explored.

Remember to keep track of all your sources and take detailed notes as you go. This will not only help in deciding the direction of your project but will also be invaluable

 I think i need to see what research is already available to decide what has already been investigated and looks promising

 Deciding the scope of your project depends on several factors, such as your interests, the time you have available, and the resources at your disposal. Here are a few considerations:

- **Depth vs. Breadth**: Focusing on one specific therapeutic, like immunotherapy for ALS, allows for a deep dive into that area. On the other hand, exploring a broader range, like various genetic therapies and diagnostic tools, can provide a comprehensive overview but might lack detail.
- **Resources**: Consider what resources and expertise you have access to. Do you have the means to conduct in-depth research on a narrow topic, or would a broader scope be more feasible?
- **Interest and Passion**: Which topic excites you the most? Your enthusiasm for a subject can greatly influence the quality of your work.
- **Impact and Relevance**: Think about the potential impact of your work. Is there a particular aspect of ALS research that is underexplored and could benefit from more attention?
- **Future Goals**: Align your project with your future academic or career goals. If you're considering a career in genetic therapy, for example, a project in that area might be more beneficial.

You could start by exploring both areas broadly and then narrow down as you find what resonates most with you. It's also perfectly acceptable to combine elements of both if they interconnect well and you can manage the scope effectively. Remember, your capstone project is an opportunity to showcase your abilities and interests, so choose a path that will be both challenging and enjoyable for you. üå¨Ô∏è‚ú®

 I‚Äôm not sure how broad to take the scope of this project, would you recommend focusing on one potential therapeutic or approach like immunotherapy for ALS or genetic therapies/diagnosing

 The article explains that ALS is incurable, and its complex nature makes diagnosis and treatment challenging, requiring multidisciplinary care. The common drug Riluzole, an anti-glutamate agent, is of debated effectiveness across all ALS stages. Edaravone and RELYVRIO, a combination of sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol, are other treatments used to manage ALS symptoms by blocking stress signals in cells to prevent nerve death. Progress in developing new treatments is slow due to limited understanding of ALS pathogenesis and progression. Studies have found inflammation and immune abnormalities in ALS patients' central nervous system, blood, and CSF. The authors' evaluation of patients' immune systems and cytokine profiles revealed various abnormalities in the immune response, with personalized precision low dose immune-modulating treatments showing positive changes and minimal toxicity.

 Sorry, summarize this part of the article- TIENTS
ALS is currently incurable and the difficulty to
efficiently diagnose and treat ALS leads to the re-
quirement of multidisciplinary care for maximized
treatment.30 One of the most common treatments for
ALS is the anti-glutamate agent known as Riluzole;
however, it is debated if this drug is an effective
treatment at all stages of ALS.31,32 Edaravone is an-
other treatment drug that‚Äôs currently used to manage
ALS. RELYVRIO which is a combination of two
drugs, sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol, act
to prevent nerve cell death by blocking stress sig-
nals in cells. The development of new treatments
has been delayed because of the difficulties in un-
derstanding the pathogenesis and basic biological
processes that trigger ALS and promote disease pro-
gression. Inflammation and immune abnormalities
have been found in the central nervous system by
pathological studies and also in the blood and CSF
of ALS patients. Our evaluation of the individual
patient‚Äôs immune system and cytokine profiles show
consistent but differing abnormalities present in
the innate and adaptive immune system and posi-
tive changes with our personalized precision low
dose immune-modulating treatments with minimal
toxicities.

 The review discusses ALS, a neurological condition that causes the loss of motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and paralysis. It usually begins in one part of the body and spreads, with patients typically living 2-5 years after symptoms begin. Currently, treatment is supportive as there's no cure. This particular study examines the clinical and immunological aspects of ALS and suggests that personalized low dose immunotherapy, based on a detailed analysis of patients' blood, may improve inflammation and immune-related issues in ALS.

 Can you summarize this too-

Neurological syndrome amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) affects motor neurons and is characterized by progressive motor neuron loss in the brain and spinal cord. ALS starts with mainly focal onset but when the disease progresses, it spreads to different parts of the body, with survival limits of 2-5 years after disease initiation. To date, only supportive care is provided for ALS patients, and no effective treatment or cure has been discovered. This review is focused on clinical and immunological aspects of ALS patients, based on our case studies, and we discuss the treatment we have provided to those patients based on a detailed evaluation of their peripheral blood immune cells and blood-derived serum secreted factors, cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. We show that using a personalized approach of low dose immunotherapy there is an improvement in the effects on inflammation and immunological dysfunction.

 The article discusses Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a neurological condition that leads to the loss of motor neurons and progressive paralysis. It usually begins in one area but spreads throughout the body, with most patients surviving 2-5 years after onset. Currently, there is no cure, and treatment is limited to supportive care. The review focuses on the clinical and immunological features of ALS based on case studies, examining patients' blood immune cells and various blood-derived factors. The authors suggest that personalized low dose immunotherapy has shown improvement in managing inflammation and immune dysfunction in ALS patients.
