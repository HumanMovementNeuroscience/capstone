 Laser dentistry involves the use of lasers to treat a variety of dental conditions. It offers a more comfortable treatment option for a number of dental procedures involving hard or soft tissue compared to drills and other non-laser tools. Here's a quick overview:

### Laser Dentistry Uses:
- **Cavity Detector**: Lasers can detect cavities early by finding evidence of tooth decay.
- **Tooth Preparations**: Lasers can eliminate the need for a local anesthetic injection and the traditional turbine dental drill.
- **Gum Disease**: Lasers are used to reshape gums and remove bacteria during root canal procedures.
- **Biopsy or Lesion Removal**: Lasers can remove a small piece of tissue (a biopsy) so that it can be examined for cancer. They can also remove lesions in the mouth and relieve the pain of canker sores.
- **Teeth Whitening**: Lasers speed up the bleaching process during teeth whitening sessions.

### Advantages of Laser Dentistry:
- **Less Pain**: Often eliminates the need for anesthesia.
- **Minimized Bleeding**: As the laser causes blood to clot immediately.
- **Reduced Swelling and Discomfort**: During and after the procedure, especially with soft tissue treatments.
- **Preservation of Tooth**: Lasers can remove cavities without taking out a large amount of tooth structure.

Laser dentistry represents a precision-focused and minimally invasive approach to dental care.
