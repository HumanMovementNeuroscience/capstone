 Regenerative dentistry is quite an in-depth field that encompasses various research areas and applications. It includes:

- **Stem Cell Research**: Focused on the isolation, characterization, and application of dental stem cells for tissue regeneration.
- **Tissue Engineering**: Developing biological substitutes to restore, maintain, or improve dental tissue function.
- **Biomaterials**: Investigating and creating materials designed to interact with biological systems for dental tissue repair and regeneration.
- **Growth Factors**: Researching proteins that stimulate the growth of tissues and cells in the oral cavity.
- **Clinical Applications**: Translating research into real-world treatments for dental issues, including the regeneration of tooth structures, periodontal regeneration, and craniofacial reconstruction.

The field is interdisciplinary, involving biology, material science, engineering, and clinical dentistry, and it's rapidly evolving with advancements in technology and biomaterials.

 Oral stem cells harvested from dental pulp, known as Dental Pulp Stem Cells (DPSCs), are a type of mesenchymal stem cell found in the soft living tissue inside teeth. They offer promising potential for regenerative dentistry because they have the ability to differentiate into a variety of cell types, including neural cells, adipocytes, osteoblasts, and odontoblasts. This versatility opens up opportunities for reconstructing bone and dentin, as well as for treating a range of oral diseases and injuries. Moreover, DPSCs are relatively easy to collect, especially from wisdom teeth extractions, and can be stored for future use. Current research is exploring their use in bio-tooth engineering and as a treatment for periodontal disease.
