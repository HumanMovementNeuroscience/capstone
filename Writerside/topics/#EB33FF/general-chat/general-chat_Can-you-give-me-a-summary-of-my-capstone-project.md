 The best reason for developing new treatments in dentistry, and in healthcare overall, is **improving patient outcomes**. This encompasses enhancing the quality of life for patients by providing:

- **More Effective Care**: New treatments that are more effective at treating and managing oral diseases.
- **Reduced Side Effects**: Treatments that minimize discomfort and have fewer adverse effects.
- **Long-Term Health Benefits**: Therapies that offer sustainable, long-lasting results.
- **Increased Accessibility**: Making care more available and affordable for a wider population.
- **Holistic Health**: Considering the patient's overall well-being, including the interplay between oral health and systemic health.

Innovations aimed at these goals can significantly impact both individual lives and public health.

 Exploring novel treatments in dentistry, particularly for oral diseases, can be crucial for several reasons:

### Reasons for Investigating Novel Treatments

- **Improving Patient Outcomes**: New therapies could offer better results compared to traditional treatments, potentially leading to faster recovery, less pain, and more successful long-term prognosis.
- **Addressing Limitations**: Current treatments might have limitations in terms of effectiveness, accessibility, or patient experience. Novel treatments could overcome these challenges.
- **Innovation and Advancement**: The field of dentistry, like any medical field, benefits from continuous research and development, leading to cutting-edge solutions that can transform patient care.
- **Preventative Care**: Innovative treatments can also focus on prevention, reducing the incidence and severity of oral diseases before they become more serious health concerns.
- **Interdisciplinary Benefits**: Understanding the link between oral health and other conditions, like cardiovascular health, emphasizes the importance of holistic healthcare approaches and can inform practices in other medical disciplines.

By focusing on novel treatments, your capstone project not only contributes to the field of dentistry but also potentially impacts broader healthcare practices.
