 Certainly, current treatments for periodontal disease focus on reducing inflammation, removing plaque and tartar, and managing the infection. Here's an overview:

### Non-Surgical Treatments
- **Scaling**: Removes tartar and bacteria from tooth surfaces and beneath gums.
- **Root Planing**: Smoothes the root surfaces, discouraging further buildup of tartar and bacteria.
- **Antibiotics**: Can be topical or oral to help control bacterial infection.

### Surgical Treatments
- **Flap Surgery (Pocket Reduction Surgery)**: Lifts back the gums to remove tartar deposits in deep pockets.
- **Bone and Tissue Grafts**: Replace and encourage regrowth of bone or gum tissue eroded by periodontal disease.
- **Guided Tissue Regeneration**: Stimulates bone and gum tissue growth.

### Emerging Treatments
- **Laser Therapy**: Targets diseased gum tissue while preserving healthy tissue.
- **Host Modulation**: Involves using medications to enhance the body's defenses to fight periodontal disease.
- **Regenerative Procedures**: Aim to regenerate lost bone and tissue supporting the teeth.

### Preventative Measures
- **Regular Dental Cleanings**: Professional cleanings at dental visits.
- **Good Oral Hygiene Practices**: Brushing twice a day, flossing, and using mouthwash.
- **Lifestyle Changes**: Quitting smoking, balanced diet, and managing underlying health conditions.

Each treatment plan is tailored to the patient's specific needs, and the severity of the disease often dictates the approach. As you develop your capstone project, it might be interesting to explore how treatment efficacy could impact cardiovascular health.

Would you like to delve into any specific treatment in more detail or explore how these treatments might relate to cardiovascular outcomes?

 Great choice for your capstone project. The link between periodontal disease and cardiovascular health is a fascinating and significant area of study with plenty of scope for research. Here's how you might approach your project:

### Research Angles
- **Literature Review**: Compile and analyze existing studies on the correlation between periodontal disease and cardiovascular disease. 
- **Biological Mechanisms**: Explore the biological and inflammatory processes that may connect periodontal disease to heart health.
- **Epidemiological Evidence**: Investigate the prevalence of both conditions and any demographic patterns.
- **Treatment Outcomes**: Review how treating periodontal disease might impact cardiovascular disease risk.

### Project Structure
- **Introduction**: Define periodontal disease and cardiovascular disease, outlining the significance of exploring their connection.
- **Methodology**: Explain how you'll collect and analyze your data, whether through meta-analysis, qualitative review, or computational methods.
- **Results**: Present your findings in a clear, logical sequence.
- **Discussion**: Interpret the results, considering limitations, implications, and potential for future research.
- **Conclusion**: Summarize your key findings and their importance to the field.

Remember, your project should aim to contribute a unique perspective or piece of knowledge to the existing body of research. Always look for gaps in the literature where your work can add value.

Would you like to start by exploring potential sources for your literature review, or do you need assistance in developing a specific research question?

 yes, I would like to focus on the aspect of periodontal disease as a marker for cardiovascular disease, or are you interested in its links to broader health conditions for my capstone project?

 Periodontal disease, also known as gum disease, is primarily an infection of the tissues that hold your teeth in place. It's typically caused by poor brushing and flossing habits that allow plaque—a sticky film of bacteria—to build up on the teeth and harden. 

In terms of it being a marker for other diseases, research has shown that periodontal disease is associated with several other health conditions, including cardiovascular disease. The theory is that inflammation caused by periodontal disease may be responsible for the association. Studies suggest that the bacteria responsible for periodontal disease can enter the bloodstream and travel to other parts of the body, potentially causing inflammation in blood vessels and supporting the development of cardiovascular disease. 

Other health issues linked with periodontal disease include diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and certain lung conditions. However, while there are associations, it's important to note that this doesn't necessarily mean that periodontal disease causes these conditions, rather that there could be a shared underlying inflammatory process or other common risk factors.
