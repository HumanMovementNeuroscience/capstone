 Absolutely, periodontal disease, also known as gum disease, is taken quite seriously in dental health. Current treatments range from non-surgical methods such as scaling and root planing (a deep cleaning method to remove plaque and tartar buildup below the gum line) to surgical treatments like flap surgery or bone and tissue grafts for more advanced cases. Additionally, there are ongoing studies on the use of laser therapy and local delivery antimicrobials as treatments. It's a rich area for research, especially when considering potential systemic connections to other health issues such as cardiovascular disease. Would you like more detailed information on any specific treatment?
