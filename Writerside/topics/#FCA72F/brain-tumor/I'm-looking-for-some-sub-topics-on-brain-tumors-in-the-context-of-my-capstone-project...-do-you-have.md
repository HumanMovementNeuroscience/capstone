 Focusing on a specific tumor type, such as glioblastomas, could provide a more in-depth analysis and could be beneficial for several reasons:

- Glioblastomas are aggressive and have significant neuropsychological implications.
- A narrow focus could lead to a more detailed and expert understanding.
- It allows for a comprehensive study of the effects of one type of tumor on neuropsychological outcomes.

Consider the scope of your project and available resources when deciding.

 Do you think it would be best to focus on a specific tumor type like glioblastomas?

 Certainly, here are some strategies to help you find relevant articles:

- Use databases like PubMed, PsycINFO, or Google Scholar with specific keywords related to your subtopics.
- Look for review articles to get an overview and then check their references for more detailed studies.
- Consider contacting authors of key studies for further insights or unpublished data.
- Use research gateways or university libraries for access to journals.

Remember to utilize filters for recent and relevant articles to stay current in the field.

 Absolutely, examining the differences in neuropsychological outcomes between benign and malignant brain tumor removal could offer valuable insights, including:

- Differences in the aggressiveness of surgical interventions
- Variations in post-surgical recovery and rehabilitation
- Long-term psychological impacts related to prognosis
- The influence of adjuvant therapies (radiation, chemotherapy) on neuropsychological functions

This could add a significant dimension to your project.

 do you think also looking at benign vs cancerous tumor removal could be a good idea

 Certainly! Here are some subtopics you might consider:

- Types of brain tumors and their locations
- Surgical techniques for tumor removal
- Pre- and post-operative neuropsychological assessment
- Impact of brain tumor location on cognitive and emotional outcomes
- Gender differences in neuropsychological outcomes after tumor removal
- Long-term neuropsychological effects of living with a brain tumor
- Case studies of brain tumor patients before and after surgery

These subtopics could provide a rich, multi-faceted exploration for your capstone project.
