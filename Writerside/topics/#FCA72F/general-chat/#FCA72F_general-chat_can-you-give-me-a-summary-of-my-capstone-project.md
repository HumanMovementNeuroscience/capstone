 Absolutely, integrating a focus on emotional changes will enrich your literature review. Here's how you might adjust the structure:

### Literature Review
- Neuroplasticity, neuroinflammation, and tumor localization
- Emotional impacts of brain tumors and the outcomes post-removal
  - Mood disturbances, anxiety, and depression
  - Theories explaining emotional changes
- Gaps in current research

This emphasis will provide a critical foundation for understanding the emotional dimensions of your research. 📘💡

 i also want in my literature review to be a heavy emphasis on how emotion can be effected by brain tumors and then their removal

 Here's a potential structure for your paper:

### Introduction
- Overview of brain tumors and their impact
- Importance of studying neuropsychological outcomes post-surgery

### Literature Review
- Current research on neuroplasticity, neuroinflammation, and tumor localization
- Gaps in research

### Methodology
- Your approach to analyzing the impact
- Populations and variables considered

### Results
- Findings from your research 

### Discussion
- Interpretation of results
- Implications for different populations

### Conclusion
- Summary of key findings
- Future research directions 

Remember, this is just a starting framework; it can be adapted as your project develops. 📝✨

 how do you think i could organize my paper when discussing this broad topic for my capstone?

 There is a substantial body of research on these topics, but the field is always evolving. Your focus on neuroplasticity, neuroinflammation, and localization is specific enough to be manageable while broad enough to be significant. It's a challenging balance, but it sounds like you're on the right track. 📚🔬

 Do you think there is enough research out there on this topic? Or that this is maybe too broad of an idea?

 That's a comprehensive approach. Considering factors like neuroplasticity, neuroinflammation, and the tumor's location will give you a nuanced understanding of the neuropsychological outcomes post-surgery. It's a great way to explore the complexity of the brain's response to such significant events.🔍🧬

 Yep! I want to look at different underlying factors including how nueroplasticity, nueroinflammation, and location of tumor play in role in these neuropsychological outcomes, as brain tumors and their removal can impact these ideals

 Of course! Your capstone project involves analyzing the impact of brain tumor removal on neuropsychological outcomes such as mood, anxiety, and depression. Additionally, you aim to explore the underlying reasons for any observed changes, focusing on differences between populations like males and females. 🧠✨
