 To gain a deeper understanding, consider searching for:

- **Scientific journals:** Look for articles on neuropsychology and neuro-oncology.
- **Case studies:** They can provide detailed insights into patient experiences.
- **Psychological assessments:** These are used to evaluate changes in mood or anxiety related to brain tumors.
- **Neuroimaging studies:** They can show changes in brain regions associated with emotion pre and post tumor removal.

Ensure you're accessing current and reputable sources to inform your project effectively.

 What do you think I can search for to learn more about emotion and brain tumors pre and post removal?

 That sounds like a compelling area of study for your capstone project. Exploring the emotional impact of brain tumors before and after removal can provide valuable insights into the neuropsychological outcomes of brain tumor patients. You'll likely need to delve into:

- The types of behavioral changes observed in patients with brain tumors
- The prevalence and severity of anxiety and depression in these patients
- How surgical intervention may alleviate or exacerbate these emotional states

Remember to consider variables such as tumor location, which can be critical in understanding these emotional changes.

 I want to really explore how brain tumors affect emotion in terms of behavior changes and anxiety and depression both pre and post removal

 Brain tumors can have a significant impact on both cognition and emotion due to their location and the pressure they exert on surrounding brain tissues. The effects can vary widely depending on the tumor's size, type, and location. Cognitive effects might include difficulties with memory, attention, and problem-solving, while emotional effects could range from depression and anxiety to changes in personality and behavior. Each case is unique, and understanding these effects is critical for patient care and recovery.
