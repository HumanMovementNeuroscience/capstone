 Emotional regulation involves several areas of the brain, including:

- The amygdala for processing emotions
- The prefrontal cortex for regulating emotions and impulses
- The hippocampus for emotional memory
- The anterior cingulate cortex for error detection and emotional responses

Understanding the roles of these areas can provide insight into how brain tumors and their removal may impact emotional regulation.

 what areas of the brain are involved in emotional regulation?

 It sounds like you're looking for a multi-faceted perspective. Here's how you might refine your search:

- Use compound search terms, such as "neuroplasticity AND neuropsychological outcomes post brain tumor removal."
- Include "pre and post-surgery" to focus on changes over time.
- Add specific neuropsychological outcomes to your terms, like "mood," "cognition," or "anxiety."
- Search for review articles first, as they can provide a broader overview and often cite primary research articles.

Additionally, consider reaching out to a librarian who can help you navigate databases and hone your search strategy.

 I'm having some trouble finding articles that align with my vision... i want to better understand how neuroplasticity, neuroinflammation, and localization might play a role in neuropsychological outcomes pre and post tumor removal

 You could search for scholarly articles using the following keywords and phrases:

- "Localization of function in brain tumor patients"
- "Functional outcomes after brain tumor surgery"
- "Neuropsychological impact of brain lesion localization"
- "Brain mapping and cognitive recovery post-tumor resection"
- "Impact of tumor location on neuropsychological functions"

Remember to use databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, and your university's library resources to access relevant studies.

 what could i search for to find articles on localization of function in this context?

 Great question! Here are a few subtopics that could enrich your capstone project:

- Cognitive recovery post-surgery
- Neuroinflammation and its psychological effects
- Neuroendocrinology and stress response after brain injury
- Neuroimaging techniques in neuropsychological assessment
- Psychosocial impacts of brain tumor diagnosis and treatment

Each of these could provide a valuable angle to your research on neuropsychological outcomes post-brain tumor removal.
