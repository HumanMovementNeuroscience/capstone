 It's a balance between what's manageable and where you see potential impact. If you are drawn to a different disorder due to its complexity or impact, it might be worth the challenge. Reflect on where your passion lies and how it aligns with your goals for the project. It's your Capstone, so choose what will be most meaningful for you to explore and present.

 i think focusing on major depressive disorder would be easier, but not necessarily the most impactful

 Focusing on one disorder could allow for a more in-depth analysis and a clearer demonstration of the relationship between exercise, gene expression, and its impact on the disorder. It could streamline your research and make your project more manageable within the timeframe. Consider which disorder interests you most or where your project could have the most impact.

 In the context of neuropsychiatric disorders, some of the conditions with a strong genetic component include:

- Bipolar disorder
- Schizophrenia
- Major depressive disorder
- Autism spectrum disorders
- Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)

These disorders often have complex inheritance patterns, involving multiple genes and interactions with environmental factors.
