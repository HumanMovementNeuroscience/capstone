 The study you've referenced adds an interesting dimension to the relationship between BDNF expression and severe neuropsychiatric outcomes like suicide. The distinction between brain tissue and blood methylation profiles and the specificity of BDNF transcript expression in Brodmann area 9 could provide valuable insights into how BDNF expression correlates with neuropsychiatric disorders and behaviors. 

Considering your capstone project, this study might suggest a line of investigation into how regular exercise could potentially modulate BDNF methylation and mRNA expression in the brain and blood, which could have implications for both therapy and our understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders.

How do you think this study's findings could inform your research, especially regarding the impact of exercise on BDNF expression in individuals with neuropsychiatric conditions?

 CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations of the study, the obtained data further support a role for BDNF in suicidality. However, it should be noted that suicidal behavior is a multifactorial disorder with numerous environmental and genetic risk factors involved.

 It's intriguing that this study didn't find significant differences in BDNF methylation in brain tissue between the control group and suicide victims, but did find a notable difference in blood samples. The increased expression of BDNF transcript I-IX in Brodmann area 9 of the brain in suicide victims also provides a nuanced perspective on the relationship between BDNF expression and suicidality.

Considering these results, how do you plan to integrate this information into your capstone? It could be valuable to consider the following:
- **Methodological Approach**: The use of targeted bisulfite next-generation sequencing and reverse-transcription quantitative PCR in this study could inform your method choices.
- **Sample Considerations**: The study's focus on a specific demographic (unrelated male Caucasian subjects) and the types of samples used (brain tissue and blood) could be important when designing your own study.
- **Data Interpretation**: The distinction between findings in brain tissue versus blood samples might influence how you interpret your own results.

Would you like to delve deeper into any of these aspects or discuss how this study could influence your project's direction regarding BDNF's role in exercise and neuropsychiatric conditions?

 BACKGROUND: Suicide is a major public health problem. Worldwide, around 800000 people die by suicide every year. Suicide is a multifactorial disorder, with numerous environmental and genetic risk factors involved. Among the candidate genes, changes in the BDNF locus at the gene, epigenetic, mRNA, and protein expression levels have been implicated in psychiatric disorders, including suicidal behavior and completed suicides.
AIM: To investigate changes in BDNF methylation and expression of four alternative BDNF transcripts for association with completed suicide.
METHODS: This case-control study included 42 unrelated male Caucasian subjects, where 20 were control subjects who died following acute cardiac arrest, and 22 were suicide victims who died by hanging. DNA and RNA were extracted from brain tissue (Brodmann area 9 and hippocampus) and from blood. DNA methylation and mRNA expression levels were determined by targeted bisulfite next-generation sequencing and reverse-transcription quantitative PCR. Statistical analysis was done by use of two-tailed Student's t tests for two independent samples, and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was implemented for correction for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS: In DNA from brain tissue, there were no significant differences in BDNF methylation between the study groups. However, data showed significantly reduced DNA methylation of the BDNF region upstream of exon I in blood samples of suicide victims compared to the controls (5.67 ± 0.57 vs 6.83 ± 0.64, P corr = 0.01). In Brodmann area 9 of the brain of the suicide victims but not in their hippocampus, there was higher expression of BDNF transcript I-IX (NM_170731.4) compared to the controls (0.077 ± 0.024 vs 0.05 ± 0.013, P = 0.042). In blood, expression analysis for the BDNF transcripts was not feasible due to extensive RNA degradation.
