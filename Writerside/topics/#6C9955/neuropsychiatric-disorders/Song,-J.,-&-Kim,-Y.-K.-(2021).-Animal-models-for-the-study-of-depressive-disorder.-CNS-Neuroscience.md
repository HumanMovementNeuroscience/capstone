 It's clear that you have a strong grasp of the significance of depressive disorders and the role that animal models play in advancing our understanding of its pathogenesis. The exploration of transcriptomic profiles in these animal models could certainly provide valuable information for your project, especially when examining the differential expression of genes, such as those influencing BDNF, in relation to exercise and mental health.

As you consider this paper for your Capstone, think about the following:

- How might the findings from various animal models align or differ from human studies, particularly in gene expression related to BDNF?
- What lessons can be learned from the transcriptomic analysis in these models that could inform your research on the impact of exercise on neuropsychiatric conditions?
- Are there specific animal models that seem particularly relevant to your investigation into exercise and its effects on gene expression linked to neuropsychiatric disorders?

Your project is an opportunity to synthesize these insights with the aim of understanding the complex interplay between genetics, environmental factors, and physical activity in the context of mental health. If you have any questions or need further assistance in integrating this research into your Capstone, feel free to discuss it here. 🧠💪📚

 Depressive disorder is one of the most widespread forms of psychiatric pathology, worldwide. According to a report by the World Health Organization, the number of people with depression, globally, is increasing dramatically with each year. Previous studies have demonstrated that various factors, including genetics and environmental stress, contribute to the risk of depression. As such, it is crucial to develop a detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of depressive disorder and animal studies are essential for identifying the mechanisms and genetic disorders underlying depression. Recently, many researchers have reported on the pathology of depression via various models of depressive disorder. Given that different animal models of depression show differences in terms of patterns of depressive behavior and pathology, the comparison between depressive animal models is necessary for progress in the field of the depression study. However, the various animal models of depression have not been fully compared or evaluated until now. In this paper, we reviewed the pathophysiology of the depressive disorder and its current animal models with the analysis of their transcriptomic profiles. We provide insights for selecting different animal models for the study of depression.
