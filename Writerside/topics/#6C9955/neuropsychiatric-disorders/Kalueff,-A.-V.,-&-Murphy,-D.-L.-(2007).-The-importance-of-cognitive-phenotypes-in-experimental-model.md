 ### Key Points for Discussion

- **Integration of Disorders:**
  - The potential role of disturbed cognitions as a common factor in the development of anxiety and depression.
  - How stress might act as a precipitating factor along this pathway.

- **High-Throughput Tests:**
  - The utilization of high-throughput tests for assessing cognitive and emotional domains in animal models.
  - The challenge of translating animal phenotypes to human brain disorders.

Considering these key points, we might explore how your capstone project could incorporate cognitive phenotypes in the context of gene expression influenced by exercise, and their implications on neuropsychiatric conditions. Would you like to focus on the methodologies for assessing cognitive functions in models or the translational challenges to human conditions?

 Cognitive dysfunctions are commonly seen in many stress-related disorders, including anxiety and depression-the world's most common neuropsychiatric illnesses. Various genetic, pharmacological, and behavioral animal models have long been used to establish animal anxiety-like and depression-like phenotypes, as well as to assess their memory, learning, and other cognitive functions. Mounting clinical and animal evidences strongly supports the notion that disturbed cognitions represent an important pathogenetic factor in anxiety and depression, and may also play a role in integrating the two disorders within a common stress-precipitated developmental pathway. This paper evaluates why and how the assessment of cognitive and emotional domains may improve our understanding of animal behaviors via different high-throughput tests and enable a better translation of animal phenotypes into human brain disorders.

 ### Discussion Starter

- **Cognitive Phenotypes in Animal Models:** 
  - How cognitive phenotypes are crucial in creating accurate animal models for anxiety and depression.
  - The link between behavior and neurobiology in these models.

Would you like to delve into the specifics of how cognitive phenotypes are determined in these models, or discuss how this paper might inform your research on gene expression and neuropsychiatric conditions?
