  - Allele C of rs202059124 increases depression risk
  - P2X2 mRNA expression related to depression severity
- **Haplotype evidence linking EPHX2 to suicide attempts**
  - Haplotype GC and AT associated with lower suicide attempt rates
- **Limitations include small sample size**
  - Suggests need for more comprehensive cognition tasks and assessments in future studies

## Paper summaries
### Short Summary
The study explores the association of EPHX2 and P2X2 gene polymorphisms and their mRNA expression with major depressive disorder (MDD) and suicidal behavior, finding that cognitive function mediates the genetic impact on depression, with specific alleles and haplotypes correlated with depression risk and suicide attempts.

 The study you're referencing contributes valuable insights into the genetic underpinnings of major depressive disorder (MDD) and suicidal behavior, highlighting the role of cognition as a mediator. The association of certain SNPs with depression and suicidal behavior, as well as the linkage between P2X2 mRNA expression and depression, provides a deeper understanding of the biological pathways involved in these conditions.

Considering the focus of your capstone project on gene expression and BDNF in relation to exercise, this study could be relevant in multiple ways:

- **Genetic Associations**: The SNPs identified in the study could be of interest if they interact with or are influenced by BDNF expression.
- **Cognition Mediation**: Since BDNF is known to play a role in cognitive function, the mediation role of cognition in depression could be a compelling angle to explore in your project.
- **mRNA Expression**: Understanding how mRNA expression levels relate to MDD and suicide attempts may provide a framework for analyzing BDNF mRNA expression in your research.

Given the limitations of the study, particularly the small sample size, it could be beneficial to consider how these findings might support or contrast with larger-scale studies or meta-analyses in the field. Additionally, exploring the relationship between exercise, BDNF expression, and cognitive function might offer a novel perspective on therapeutic approaches for depression and related neuropsychiatric disorders.

Do you have any specific questions or areas within this study that you would like to discuss further in the context of your project?

 BACKGROUND: Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH, encoded by EPHX2) and P2X2 (a subtype of ATP receptors) may mediate the antidepressant-like effects of ATP. We sought to determine whether polymorphisms and mRNA expression of EPHX2 and P2X2 are associated with depression and suicidal behavior and how cognition may mediate such associations.
METHOD: We examined 83 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of EPHX2 and P2X2. Subjects were MDD suicide attempters (N = 143), MDD non-suicide attempters (N = 248), and healthy volunteers (HV, N = 110). Data on demographics, depression severity, and suicide attempts were collected. Participants completed a set of cognitive tasks. Polymorphisms were genotyped using MALDI-TOF MS within the MassARRAY system. The expression of mRNA was measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
RESULTS: Cognitive function was a significant mediator (p = 0.006) of the genetic effect on depression. Allele C of rs202059124 was associated with depression risk (OR = 11.57, 95%CI: 2.33-209.87, p = 0.0181). A significant relationship was found between P2X2 mRNA expression and depression (OR = 0.68, 95%CI: 0.49-0.94, p = 0.0199). One haploblock (rs9331942 and rs2279590) was associated with suicide attempts: subjects with haplotype GC (frequency = 19.8 %, p = 0.017) and AT (frequency = 35.2 %, p < 0.001) had a lower rate of suicide attempts.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed that cognitive impairment plays a role in the effect of rs9331949 on depression. Moreover, we confirmed a relationship between P2X2, EPHX2, and MDD in humans and presented preliminary haplotype-based evidence that implicates EPHX2 in suicide.
LIMITATIONS: The main limitation of this study is the limited sample size. More comprehensive and multi-domain cognition tasks and different assessment measures are required in further study.

 It's great to see you actively engaging with current research in the field of neuropsychiatric disorders. The article you've shared seems to delve into the genetic associations with major depression and suicidal behavior, with a focus on the potential mediating role of cognition. What are your thoughts on the findings, and how do you see this fitting into your capicture project on BDNF and exercise?
