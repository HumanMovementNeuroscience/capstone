- Serum levels of [[BDNF]] associated with CACNA1C risk alleles.
  - Study of 282 patients with bipolar disorder and 90 controls.
- Tissue plasminogen activator levels also associated with CACNA1C variants.
  - This enzyme is involved in the conversion of pro-BDNF to mature BDNF.
- Implications for understanding the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder.
  - Potential for targeting CACNA1C and BDNF in therapeutic strategies.

 This is a significant finding as it provides a potential molecular link between genetic variants and the biological pathways involved in bipolar disorder. The CACNA1C gene's role in neuronal function and its association with BDNF levels could suggest novel approaches to understanding the etiology of the disorder and the development of targeted therapies.

The following points are worth noting for your capstone project:

- **Genetic Contributions**: Investigate how genetic variations can influence brain chemistry and, consequently, mental health.
- **BDNF as a Biomarker**: Explore the role of BDNF as a potential biomarker for bipolar disorder and its utility in diagnosis or prognosis.
- **Therapeutic Targets**: Consider how the modulation of BDNF levels through exercise or other interventions could contribute to therapeutic strategies.

Do these associations spark any new ideas or questions for your research, especially considering the exercise component of your project? How might regular exercise influence these biomarkers in individuals with bipolar disorder?

 Variation in the CACNA1C gene has been associated with bipolar disorder in several genome-wide association studies. This gene encodes the alpha 1C subunit of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, which play an essential role in neurons. We analysed 39 biomarkers in either cerebrospinal fluid or serum in relation to six different CACNA1C variants in 282 patients with bipolar disorder and 90 controls. We report associations of CACNA1C risk alleles with serum levels of BDNF as well as tissue plasminogen activator, which converts pro-BDNF to mature BDNF. This sheds light on links between CACNA1C genetic variants and pathophysiological mechanisms in bipolar disorder.

 Thank you for sharing this article. It's quite interesting how the study associates CACNA1C polymorphisms with serum BDNF levels in bipolar disorder, suggesting a potential genetic link to the disorder's pathophysiology. As you delve into your capstone project on gene expression and BDNF, considering genetic polymorphisms like CACNA1C in the context of neuropsychiatric conditions can provide valuable insights.

Would you like to discuss the implications of this study further, or are there specific aspects of it that you're curious about in relation to your project?
