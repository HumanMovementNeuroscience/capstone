## Detailed Summary
- Introduction to the challenge of delivering biologics across the BBB to treat brain diseases.
  - Current biologics are unable to treat brain diseases noninvasively.
- The study explores the potential of BDNF, co-administered with BBBM peptide ADTC5, to treat EAE mice.
  - BDNF + ADTC5 leads to enhanced brain delivery and TrkB receptor phosphorylation.
- Results show suppression of EAE relapse and induction of neuroregeneration in treated mice.
  - Visible activation of oligodendrocytes and remyelination observed.
  - Upregulation of ARC and EGR1 mRNA transcripts detected.

## Paper summaries
### Short Summary
The study demonstrates a noninvasive method to deliver BDNF into the brain of EAE mice using ADTC5 peptide, which enhances BDNF brain uptake and triggers neuroregeneration and disease relapse suppression.

 The study you're referencing is indeed significant as it presents a novel approach for delivering biologics across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which has been a major challenge in treating central nervous system (CNS) diseases. The successful delivery of BDNF into the brain using the BBB modulator peptide ADTC5 is a remarkable finding, especially considering the observed therapeutic effects in EAE mice, a model for MS.

Considering your capstone focus on gene expression in relation to exercise and neuropsychiatric conditions, this study could be relevant in several ways:

- **Therapeutic Implications**: Understanding the mechanisms of BDNF delivery could inform potential treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders. If exercise upregulates BDNF expression, finding noninvasive methods to enhance its delivery and action in the brain could be synergistic with exercise-induced benefits.

- **Mechanistic Insights**: The study illustrates the role of BDNF in neuroregeneration and remyelination, which could be crucial in understanding how exercise might confer neuroprotective effects.

- **Methodological Approach**: The techniques used in the study for assessing BDNF delivery and efficacy (e.g., Western blot, mRNA transcript analysis) could guide the experimental design of your project.

Would you like to discuss how these themes might integrate into your project, or is there a specific aspect of the research methodology or findings that you want to delve deeper into? ðŸŒŸðŸ“š

 The number of FDA-approved protein drugs (biologics), such as antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, hormones, and enzymes, continues to grow at a rapid rate; most of these drugs are used to treat diseases of the peripheral body. Unfortunately, most of these biologics cannot be used to treat brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and brain tumors in a noninvasive manner due to their inability to permeate the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Therefore, there is a need to develop an effective method to deliver protein drugs into the brain. Here, we report a proof of concept to deliver a recombinant brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to the brains of healthy and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice via intravenous (iv) injections by co-administering BDNF with a BBB modulator (BBBM) peptide ADTC5. Western blot evaluations indicated that ADTC5 enhanced the brain delivery of BDNF in healthy SJL/elite mice compared to BDNF alone and triggered the phosphorylation of TrkB receptors in the brain. The EAE mice treated with BDNF + ADTC5 suppressed EAE relapse compared to those treated with BDNF alone, ADTC5 alone, or vehicle. We further demonstrated that brain delivery of BDNF induced neuroregeneration via visible activation of oligodendrocytes, remyelination, and ARC and EGR1 mRNA transcript upregulation. In summary, we have demonstrated that ADTC5 peptide modulates the BBB to permit noninvasive delivery of BDNF to exert its neuroregeneration activity in the brains of EAE mice.

 It seems like you're referencing a study that explores the delivery and effects of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) on neuroregeneration and disease relapse in mice with Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. That's an exciting area of research!

What aspects of this study are you interested in discussing in relation to your capstone project? Are you looking at the methodology, the results, or how it could inform your research on BDNF expression in relation to exercise and neuropsychiatric conditions? ðŸŒ¿âœ¨
