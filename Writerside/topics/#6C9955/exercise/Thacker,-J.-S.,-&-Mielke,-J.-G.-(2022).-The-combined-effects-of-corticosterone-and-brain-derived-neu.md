 # Thacker & Mielke 2022 - Exercise-induced synaptic modulation
## Title
The combined effects of corticosterone and brain-derived neurotrophic factor on plasticity-related receptor phosphorylation and expression at the synaptic surface in male Sprague-Dawley rats

Hormones and Behavior, 145, 105233. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2022.105233

## Basic Methodology
- Tissue slices from male Sprague-Dawley rats' sensorimotor cortex were used.
- Acute incubation with CORT, BDNF, or CORT+BDNF for 30 minutes.
- Immunoblotting with biotinylated synaptoneurosomes to analyze protein enrichment from the synaptic surface.

## Detailed Summary
- Acute exercise may heighten neuroplasticity, enhancing learning when paired with motor training.
  - Mechanisms of exercise-induced priming are not fully understood.
- Previous rodent model of acute exercise showed enhancement in glutamatergic receptor phosphorylation.
  - Uncertain if peripheral factors like glucocorticoids or central effects like BDNF or both are responsible.
- Study explored the contributions of CORT and BDNF, individually and combined, on glutamate receptor phosphorylation and synaptic surface expression.
  - CORT enhanced NMDA and AMPA receptor phosphorylation.
  - BDNF increased synaptic surface expression of NMDA and AMPA receptor subunits.
  - Combined CORT+BDNF resulted in phosphorylation without surface expression.
- Provides a mechanistic framework for CORT and BDNF's role in altering glutamatergic synapses during

 This is an intriguing study that provides a detailed look at how acute exercise could potentially influence synaptic plasticity through the modulation of glutamatergic receptor phosphorylation and expression. The differential effects of corticosterone (CORT) and BDNF, as well as their combined impact, offer valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms that might underlie the benefits of exercise on the brain.

For your capstone project, examining the differential gene expression related to BDNF between active and inactive individuals, this study could serve as a foundational piece. You might consider:

- Investigating if the exercise-induced enhancement in receptor phosphorylation observed in rats also occurs in humans, particularly in the context of neuropsychiatric conditions.
- Exploring the role of glucocorticoids and BDNF in the human brain following exercise and how it relates to your gene expression data.
- Considering the temporal aspects of exercise-induced changes in receptor phosphorylation and expression, and how they might align with the timing of gene expression changes you observe.

How do you plan to incorporate these mechanistic insights into the broader context of your project, especially considering the potential for therapeutic interventions for neuropsychiatric disorders?

 Following acute exercise, a temporal window exists wherein neuroplasticity is thought to be heightened. Although a number of studies have established that pairing this post-exercise period with motor training enhances learning, the mechanisms through which exercise-induced priming occurs are not well understood. Previously, we characterized a rodent model of acute exercise that generates significant enhancement in glutamatergic receptor phosphorylation as a possible mechanism to explain how exercise-induced priming might occur. However, whether these changes are stimulated by peripheral factors (e.g., glucocorticoids), central effects (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), or a combination of the two remains unclear. Herein, we explored the possible individual and/or cumulative contribution corticosterone (CORT) and BDNF may have on glutamate receptor phosphorylation and synaptic surface expression. Tissue slices from the sensorimotor cortex were prepared and acutely (30 min) incubated with either CORT (200 nM), BDNF (20 ng/mL), or the simultaneous application of CORT and BDNF (CORT+BDNF). Immunoblotting with biotinylated synaptoneurosomes (which provide an enrichment of proteins from the synaptic surface) suggested divergent effects between CORT and BDNF. Acute CORT application enhanced NMDA- (GluN2A, B) and AMPA- (GluA1) receptor phosphorylation, whereas BDNF preferentially increased synaptic surface expression of both NMDA- and AMPA-receptor subunits. The combined effects of CORT+BDNF resulted in a unique subset of signaling patterns that favored phosphorylation in the absence of surface expression. Taken together, these data provide a mechanistic framework for how CORT and BDNF may alter glutamatergic synapses during exercise-induced priming.

 Thank you for sharing this reference. It looks like Thacker and Mielke's study delves into the interplay between corticosterone, BDNF, and synaptic plasticity. How does this paper inform your project on the differential expression of genes related to BDNF with regards to exercise? What specific aspects of their research are you looking to integrate or expand upon in your own work?
