A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Resistance Training on Quality of Life, Depression, Muscle Strength, and Functional Exercise Capacity in Older Adults Aged 60 Years or More. Biological Research for Nursing, 25(1), 88–106. https://doi.org/10.1177/10998004221120945

## Basic Methodology
A systematic search and meta-analysis of studies investigating the impact of resistance training on older adults.

## Detailed Summary
- **Background:** Aging is associated with changes leading to chronic conditions and decreased quality of life.
  - Susceptibility to various health issues increases with age.
- **Objective:** To assess the efficacy of resistance training on quality of life and health in older adults.
  - Focused on improvements in mental and physical health metrics.
- **Data Sources:** Utilized databases including PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, Google Scholar, and Scopus.
  - Comprehensive search up to December 20, 2021.
- **Results:** 21 studies included, showing significant improvements in various health domains.
  - Notable benefits in physical and mental health, muscle strength, and reduction in depression.
- **Conclusion:** Resistance training can effectively enhance quality of life and health in the elderly.
  - Further research is necessary for conclusive evidence.

 Thank you for sharing the background, objective, data sources, results, and conclusion of the study. This research provides valuable insights into the positive effects of resistance training on older adults' mental and physical health. 

For your capstone project focusing on gene expression related to exercise, this study could serve as a strong reference point for the benefits of physical activity, specifically resistance training, on health outcomes. It could help frame the broader context of how exercise can be a potential therapeutic intervention for improving quality of life and mental health conditions, which might be mediated by genetic factors like the expression of BDNF.

Considering these findings:
- You may want to explore the molecular mechanisms by which resistance training could lead to improvements in the areas highlighted by the study.
- Investigate the specific genetic expression changes in older adults who engage in resistance training and how this compares to your target demographic.
- Look at the intersection of resistance training with neuropsychiatric conditions to see if there are any gene expression patterns that are commonly affected.

Would you like to discuss how to incorporate this data into your methodology or delve into the genetic mechanisms that could be at play here?

 BACKGROUND: Aging is generally associated with numerous metabolic and physical changes that augment susceptibility to several chronic conditions, disability, and diminished quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to investigate the efficacy of resistance training on quality of life, depression, muscle strength, and functional exercise capacity in older adults (≥60 years).
DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, Google Scholar, and Scopus up to December 20, 2021.
RESULTS: 21 studies (N = 1610) were included. Resistance training significantly improved physical functioning (standard mean differences (SMD), 0.31; p = 0.02), mental health (SMD, 0.44; p = 0.001), bodily pain (SMD, -0.52; p = 0.004), general health (SMD, 0.43; p = 0.002), social functioning (SMD, 0.25; p = 0.006), and mental component score (SMD, 0.51; p = 0.001) subscales. Moreover, depression (SMD, -1.13; p = 0.01), upper-limb muscle strength (mean difference (MD), 15.26 kg; p = 0.002), lower-limb muscle strength (MD, 48.46 kg; p = 0.02), and handgrip muscle strength (MD, 1.35 kg; p = 0.003) significantly improved following resistance training. No benefits were found for vitality, physical component score, total score of quality of life, and the 6-min walk distance.
CONCLUSION: Preliminary evidence reveals that resistance training can be effective for improving most domains of quality of life, upper- and lower-limb muscle strength, handgrip strength, and depression in aged people. More proof is hence needed to draw solid conclusions.
