## Basic Methodology
A systematic review was conducted with databases Medline(PubMed), EMBASE, and psycINFO up to April 2015. Individual and composite moderators were summarized, and the evidence strength was assessed.

## Detailed Summary
- **Identification of factors moderating exercise's antidepressant effects in MDD**
  - Could aid in pinpointing patient sub-groups with higher benefit potential.
- **Systematic review of databases**
  - Medline(PubMed), EMBASE, and psycINFO scrutinized up to April 2015.
- **Potential moderators identified**
  - Biological, clinical, psychological, and social factors; composite moderators like BDNF x BMI interaction.
- **Evidence strength**
  - Two biological features and the BDNF x BMI interaction provided confirmatory evidence.
- **Limitations**
  - Varied statistical approaches and exploratory nature of evidence limit generalization.
- **Conclusion**
  - Need for further studies with a-priori moderator analysis for personalized medicine in exercise for depression.

 **Introduction**
- The effectiveness of exercise as an antidepressant for individuals with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) varies.
- Identifying moderating factors could pinpoint patient sub-groups most likely to benefit from exercise.

**Methods**
- A systematic review of literature through April 2015.
- Various databases were used to gather relevant studies.
- Moderators were identified and evidence strength assessed.

**Results**
- Eleven studies were analyzed, revealing several potential individual and composite moderators.
- Confirmed moderators included two biological and the interaction between BDNF and BMI.
- Psychological, social, and other individual factors were suggested but not confirmed.

**Limitations**
- Diverse statistical methods across studies prevented meta-analysis.
- A small number of studies and exploratory evidence limit the generalization of findings.

**Conclusion**
- Multiple moderating factors were proposed for the antidepressant effects of exercise.
- The need for more research with a focus on moderators was emphasized to improve personalized medicine approaches.

This study aligns with your project's interest in BDNF gene expression. The BDNF x BMI interaction as a moderator is particularly intriguing and may provide a valuable angle for your research. How do you see this study influencing your capstone project?

 Introduction
Exercise have antidepressant effects in people with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). However, about to half of patients do not respond to exercise. The identification of factors that moderates the antidepressant effects of exercise in people with MDD may help researchers and health professionals to identify sub-groups of patients that would benefit more from exercise.
Methods
A systematic review was carried out using Medline(PubMed), EMBASE and psycINFO up to April 2015. Individual and composite moderators were summarized and the strength of the evidence was assessed.
Results
Eleven studies were included for review resulting in the identification of potential individual (two biological, three clinical, two psychological and two social individual) and two potential composite moderators (the interaction between BDNF and Body Mass Index (BMI) and between family history of mental illness and gender). Only the two biological features and the BDNF x BMI interaction provided confirmatory evidence.
Limitations
Due the different statistical approaches used in the studies, it was not possible to perform meta-analyses. The small number of studies and the exploratory nature of the evidence limits a wider generalization of the findings.
Conclusion
Potential clinical, psychological, social or biological moderators were identified. However, the small number of studies and the limited strength of the evidence requires further studies before drawn definitive results. Further trials should consider the inclusion of moderators analysis using an a-priori, theoretical/evidence based hypothesis in order to provide high quality evidence for the use of personalized medicine in exercise for depression.
