Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle, 13(4), 1983–1994. https://doi.org/10.1002/jcsm.12963

## Basic Methodology
- Analytic sample of 162,167 participants, aged 38-70 years, from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study.
- Handgrip strength (HGS) assessed using dynamometry.

  - Assessed the impact of a 5 kg lower HGS on mental health risks.
  - Evaluated the risks across different socio-demographic, lifestyle, and health-related factors.
- Findings suggest a significant inverse relationship between HGS and incident mental health problems.
  - Each 5 kg decrease in HGS linked to a 7-8% higher risk of depression and anxiety.
  - Participants in the lowest tertile for HGS had a 24-27% higher risk of these conditions.
- Noted stronger associations in certain subgroups, such as those with a brisk walking pace and older, more affluent participants.

 The conclusions from the study you've cited offer significant insights into the potential of utilizing handgrip strength as an indicator for the risk of developing mental health issues like depression and anxiety. The association between lower HGS and a higher incidence of these conditions suggests a link between physical strength and mental health.

For your capstone project, this raises important questions about the role of exercise, particularly resistance training, in neuropsychiatric conditions. It also highlights the potential for preventive strategies that could be implemented in clinical practice.

Considering these findings:

- How might you incorporate the concept of resistance training or measurable physical strength markers into your project?
- Do you see a pathway for exploring the relationship between BDNF gene expression and the types of physical exercises that might improve HGS, and in turn, possibly reduce the risk of depression and anxiety?

These are avenues that could be worth exploring in the context of your research on the differential expression of genes and the impacts of exercise on neuropsychiatric conditions. 📊💪🧠

 CONCLUSIONS: Handgrip strength was inversely associated with incident depression and anxiety. Because HGS is a simple, non-invasive, and inexpensive measure, it could be easily used in clinical practice to stratify patients and identify those at elevated risk of mental health problems. However, future research should assess if resistance training aimed at increasing HGS can prevent the occurrence of mental health conditions.

 The methodology and results of this study are quite insightful. The use of Cox proportional models and the findings indicating a significant association between handgrip strength and the risk of depression and anxiety highlight the potential importance of physical strength and, by extension, physical activity in mental health.

As you think about these findings:

- How might they inform your investigation into the differential gene expression related to BDNF in individuals who exercise regularly?
- Could you consider integrating a measure of physical strength or activity level into your own research methods?
- What implications do these results have for the potential therapeutic role of exercise in neuropsychiatric conditions?

Remember, the connection between physical exercise and mental health can be multifaceted, involving not just physiological changes but also psychosocial factors. 🤔💪🧠

 METHODS: The analytic sample comprised 162 167 participants (55% women), aged 38-70 years, from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study. HGS was assessed at baseline using dynamometry. Depression and anxiety were extracted from primary care and hospital admission records. Cox proportional models were applied, with a 2 year landmark analysis, to investigate the associations between HGS and incident depression and anxiety.
RESULTS: Of the 162 167 participants included, 5462 (3.4%) developed depression and 6614 (4.1%) anxiety, over a median follow-up period of 10.0 years (inter-quartile range: 9.3-10.8) for depression and 9.9 (inter-quartile range: 9.0-10.8) for anxiety. In the fully adjusted model, a 5 kg lower HGS was associated with a 7% (HR: 1.07 [95% CI: 1.05, 1.10]; P < 0.001) and 8% (HR: 1.08 [95% CI: 1.06, 1.10]; P < 0.001) higher risk of depression and anxiety, respectively. Compared with participants in the sex and age-specific highest tertiles of HGS, those in the medium and lowest tertiles had an 11% (HR: 1.11 [95% CI: 1.04, 1.19]; P = 0.002) and 24% (HR: 1.24 [95% CI: 1.16, 1.33]; P < 0.001) higher risk of depression and 13% (HR: 1.13 [95% CI: 1.06, 1.20]; P < 0.001) and 27% (HR: 1.27 [95% CI: 1.19, 1.35]; P < 0.001) higher risk of anxiety, respectively. The association of HGS with depression was stronger among participants with average or brisk walking pace (vs. slow walking pace; Pinteraction  < 0.001). The association with anxiety was stronger in those participants aged ≥58 years (vs. ≤58 years; Pinteraction  = 0.002) and those living in more affluent areas (vs. deprived; Pinteraction  = 0.001).

 The background you've provided outlines the significance of understanding modifiable factors, like handgrip strength (HGS), that could potentially influence the incidence of depression and anxiety. It's an intriguing area of research that aligns well with your capstone project's focus on exercise and neuropsychiatric disorders.

Considering the socio-demographic, lifestyle, and health-related factors in your project could provide a comprehensive view of how exercise and gene expression potentially affect mental health. 

How do you plan on integrating these elements into your project? Are you considering a similar approach to assessing physical strength or another exercise metric in your research on BDNF expression? 🧬🏃‍♂️🧠

 BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are the leading mental health problems worldwide; depression is ranked as the leading cause of global disability with anxiety disorders ranked sixth. Preventive strategies based on the identification of modifiable factors merit exploration. The aim of the present study was to investigate the associations of handgrip strength (HGS) with incident depression and anxiety and to explore how these associations differ by socio-demographic, lifestyle, and health-related factors.
