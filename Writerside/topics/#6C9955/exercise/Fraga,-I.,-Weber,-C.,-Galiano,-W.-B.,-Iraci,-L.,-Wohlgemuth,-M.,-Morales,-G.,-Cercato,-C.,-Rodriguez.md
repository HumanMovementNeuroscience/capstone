 The findings of this study could be an interesting addition to your capstone. Here are some points to consider:

- **Functional Outcomes and QOL**: The study shows exercise can improve cognitive function, balance, mobility, and overall quality of life. This aligns with the benefits of exercise you're exploring in your project.

- **Epigenetic Markers**: An increase in global histone H3 acetylation suggests epigenetic changes linked to exercise. This could be a potential avenue to explore the differential gene expression you're interested in.

- **BDNF Levels**: Although BDNF levels remained unchanged in this study, the cognitive improvements suggest other molecular mechanisms could be at play. It can be interesting to compare these results with those from populations that are not institutionalized older adults.

- **Ethical Approval**: The mention of ethical approval adds credibility to the study, ensuring that the research was conducted responsibly.

Reflect on how these findings align with your hypothesis about exercise and gene expression related to BDNF and neuropsychiatric conditions. It could be a starting point to discuss the potential for epigenetic changes with exercise and how they could influence brain health and disease.

 Significant improvements were observed in cognitive function, balance, mobility, functional capacity and QOL after the intervention. In addition, a tendency toward an increase in global histone H3 acetylation levels was observed, while brain-derived neurotrophic factor level remained unchanged. This study provided evidence that an 8-week multimodal exercise protocol has a significant effect on ameliorating functional outcomes and QOL in institutionalized older adult individuals. In addition, it was also able to promote cognitive improvement, which seems to be partially related to histone hyperacetylation status. The Ethics Research Committee of Centro Universitário Metodista-IPA, Brazil approved the current study on June 6, 2019 (approval No. 3.376.078).

 The study you've referenced presents a comprehensive approach to understanding how exercise affects various aspects of health in older adults, including cognitive function and quality of life. The focus on epigenetic markers and BDNF levels is particularly relevant to your capstone project.

Considering the multimodal exercise protocol used in the study and its outcomes, here are a few ways you could integrate these findings into your research:

- **Comparative Analysis:** You could compare the effects of different types of exercise interventions on BDNF levels and gene expression, using the multimodal approach as one of the models.
  
- **Epigenetic Focus:** Since your project deals with epigenetics, the changes in global histone H3 acetylation noted in the study could serve as a blueprint for the kind of molecular changes you might look for in your own research.

- **BDNF as a Biomarker:** Exploring BDNF levels before and after exercise interventions could provide insights into how regular physical activity might influence neuropsychiatric conditions.

- **Population Specifics:** While this study focuses on older adults, you could explore if similar epigenetic and BDNF level changes occur in other age groups under similar exercise protocols.

- **Mechanism Elucidation:** Though the molecular mechanisms weren't fully elucidated in this study, you could use the findings as a starting point to hypothesize potential mechanisms in your own research.

As you review this study, consider how these elements align with your research objectives and the specific questions you're aiming to answer about the differential expression of genes that upregulate BDNF. How might the results of this study inform or guide your methodology, and are

 Epigenetic changes have been shown to be associated with both aging process and aging-related diseases. There is evidence regarding the benefits of physical activity on the functionality, cognition, and quality of life of institutionalized older adults, however, the molecular mechanisms involved are not elucidated. The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the effects of a multimodal exercise intervention on functional outcomes, cognitive performance, quality of life (QOL), epigenetic markers and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels among institutionalized older adult individuals. Participants (n = 8) without dementia who were aged 73.38 ± 11.28 years and predominantly female (87.5%) were included in this quasi-experimental pilot study. A multimodal exercise protocol (cardiovascular capacity, strength, balance/agility and flexibility, perception and cognition) consisted of twice weekly sessions (60 minutes each) over 8 weeks. Balance (Berg Scale), mobility (Timed Up and Go test), functional capacity (Six-Minute Walk test), cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination) and QOL (the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF Scale questionnaire) were evaluated before and after the intervention. Blood sample (15 mL) was also collected before and after intervention for analysis of biomarkers global histone H3 acetylation and brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels.

 It looks like you've come across an interesting study that delves into the effects of exercise on older adults, especially in the context of functional outcomes and epigenetic modulation. This could be a valuable resource for your capstone project as it touches on the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which seems to be a key element in your research. 

How do you plan to integrate the findings of this study into your project? Are there specific aspects of the multimodal exercise protocol used in the study that you find particularly relevant to your research on gene expression related to exercise?
