 Fantastic! To incorporate these findings into your Capstone project, consider the following steps:

- **Research Review**: Start with a thorough literature review to identify key studies that have explored the relationship between exercise types and mental wellness.
- **Data Analysis**: Look for meta-analyses or systematic reviews comparing the effects of aerobic vs. resistance training on mental health outcomes.
- **Hypothesis Formation**: Formulate a hypothesis based on the literature about how different exercise regimens might affect gene expression related to BDNF and mental health.
- **Methodology Design**: Plan a study or series of studies to test your hypothesis. This could involve experimental designs or the use of pre-existing data sets.
- **Data Collection and Tools**: Determine what data you'll need and what tools or methods (like surveys, clinical assessments, or genetic profiling) you'll use to collect this data.
- **Analysis and Presentation**: Decide how you'll analyze the data to draw meaningful conclusions and how youâ€™ll present this in your final Capstone project.

Remember, your Capstone project should not only reflect a comprehensive understanding of the topic but also your ability to conduct independent research. Would you like assistance in any specific area?

 Great, let's break it down:

- **Aerobic Exercise:**
  - Enhances the release of endorphins, which are natural mood lifters.
  - Increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), promoting neurogenesis and resilience against stress.

- **Resistance Training:**
  - Has been linked to reductions in anxiety and depression symptoms.
  - May improve cognitive function by increasing levels of growth factors like IGF-1.

Both exercise types can lead to improvements in mood and mental health, but they might do so through different physiological pathways. Would you like to discuss how to incorporate these findings into your Capstone project?

 Yes, there are numerous studies examining the effects of various types of exercise on perceived wellness and depression scores. For instance:

- Aerobic exercises like running and swimming have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression.
- Resistance training has also been linked with improvements in mood and anxiety levels.

Each type of exercise stimulates the brain differently, potentially leading to varying impacts on mental health. Would you like to delve into more specifics on how these exercise forms influence brain function and mental health?
