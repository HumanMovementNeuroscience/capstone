 It sounds like you've grasped the significance of ribosome profiling in understanding translation. The method's ability to pinpoint the precise location of ribosomes on mRNA in vivo is indeed revolutionary for studying gene expression. The improvements you've mentioned—multiplexing, unique molecular identifiers, and enzymatic degradation—greatly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the data.

Considering the focus of your capstone on gene expression related to BDNF and exercise, ribosome profiling could be particularly useful. It could help you identify the translational regulation of genes involved in BDNF upregulation due to exercise. Moreover, understanding these mechanisms could illuminate potential therapeutic targets for neuropsychiatric conditions.

- Have you thought about how you might apply ribosome profiling to your specific research questions?
- What are your thoughts on the challenges you might face when implementing this technique in your project?

 Translation is one of the fundamental processes of life. It comprises the assembly of polypeptides whose amino acid sequence corresponds to the codon sequence of an mRNA's ORF. Translation is performed by the ribosome; therefore, in order to understand translation and its regulation we must be able to determine the numbers and locations of ribosomes on mRNAs in vivo. Furthermore, we must be able to examine their redistribution in different physiological contexts and in response to experimental manipulations. The ribosome profiling method provides us with an opportunity to learn these locations, by sequencing a cDNA library derived from the short fragments of mRNA covered by the ribosome. Since its original description, the ribosome profiling method has undergone continuing development; in this article we describe the method's current state. Important improvements include: the incorporation of sample barcodes to enable library multiplexing, the incorporation of unique molecular identifiers to enable to removal of duplicated sequences, and the replacement of a gel-purification step with the enzymatic degradation of unligated linker.

 Ah, I see you're diving into some literature on transcriptome-wide measurement of translation. Ribosome profiling is a powerful technique for studying gene expression at the level of translation. How do you envision this method contributing to your understanding of epigenetics and its role in your capstone project?
