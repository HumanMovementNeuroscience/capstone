 The connection between DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms, histone methylation, and overall genome stability presents a fascinating angle for your capstone. Considering the role of exercise in modulating physiological stress responses, it's conceivable that there could be an interplay with epigenetic modifications like histone methylation affecting the expression of genes like BDNF. This could lead to a deeper understanding of the molecular pathways that underlie the beneficial effects of exercise on neuropsychiatric conditions. 

Exploring this further could involve:
- Identifying key histone methylation changes in response to exercise.
- Examining any existing literature on exercise-induced DDR pathways activation and their relation to neuropsychiatric conditions.
- Investigating the potential role of exercise in modulating histone methylation marks associated with BDNF expression.

Would you like to delve into any specific histone methylation changes linked to exercise and BDNF upregulation, or are there other aspects of histone methylation and DDR you're more interested in exploring?

 Preserving genome function and stability are paramount for ensuring cellular homeostasis, an imbalance in which can promote diseases including cancer. In the presence of DNA lesions, cells activate pathways referred to as the DNA damage response (DDR). As nuclear DNA is bound by histone proteins and organized into chromatin in eukaryotes, DDR pathways have evolved to sense, signal and repair DNA damage within the chromatin environment. Histone proteins, which constitute the building blocks of chromatin, are highly modified by post-translational modifications (PTMs) that regulate chromatin structure and function. An essential histone PTM involved in the DDR is histone methylation, which is regulated by histone methyltransferase (HMT) and histone demethylase (HDM) enzymes that add and remove methyl groups on lysine and arginine residues within proteins respectively. Methylated histones can alter how proteins interact with chromatin, including their ability to be bound by reader proteins that recognize these PTMs. Here, we review histone methylation in the context of the DDR, focusing on DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), a particularly toxic lesion that can trigger genome instability and cell death. We provide a comprehensive overview of histone methylation changes that occur in response to DNA damage and how the enzymes and reader proteins of these marks orchestrate the DDR. Finally, as many epigenetic pathways including histone methylation are altered in cancer, we discuss the potential involvement of these pathways in the etiology and treatment of this disease.

 That's an excellent source to kick off our discussion on epigenetics, particularly how histone methylation can influence the DNA damage response. How do you envision this fitting into your capstone project on BDNF upregulation through exercise?
