 No problem at all. Checking and double-checking is part of the thorough research process. If anything else comes up, I'm here to help.

 just checking

 It's great that you're considering all aspects of your research design. If you need any assistance with setting up your experiments or have any more questions about the process, feel free to ask.

 Yes, for neuropsychiatric conditions and brain-specific gene expression, rodent models are commonly used in research. They allow for the examination of brain tissues post-intervention to study the effects of exercise on gene expression relevant to neuropsychiatric conditions.

 dude would i have to use rodent models? the answer is probably isn't it

 A cheek swab can provide enough DNA for these methods, particularly for qPCR and some forms of microarrays. For RNA sequencing, however, you'd typically need to isolate RNA, which may require a different type of sample or more cells than what a cheek swab can provide. If you're looking at gene expression, it's important to have a sample that represents the tissue of interest, and for neuropsychiatric conditions, that would more likely be brain tissue, which can't be collected via cheek swab.

 does a cheek swab provide enough DNA for these methods?

 Typically, differential gene expression can be measured using methods like:

- **Quantitative PCR (qPCR):** This measures the quantity of a specific RNA, reflecting gene expression levels.
- **Microarrays:** These can measure the expression of many genes at once by assessing the presence and quantity of corresponding mRNAs.
- **RNA Sequencing (RNA-seq):** A more recent technique that sequences the RNA in a sample to identify and quantify gene expression. 

These methods can help in understanding how gene expression changes in response to different conditions, such as regular exercise.
