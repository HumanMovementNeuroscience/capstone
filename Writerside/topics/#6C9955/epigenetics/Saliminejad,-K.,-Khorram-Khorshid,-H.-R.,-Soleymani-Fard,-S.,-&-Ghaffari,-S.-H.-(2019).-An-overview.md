 It's fascinating how microRNAs play such a critical role in the regulation of gene expression and have potential therapeutic applications. Their involvement in various cellular processes and diseases makes them a significant area of study in epigenetics and therapeutics. Given your interest in the differential expression of genes that upregulate BDNF between individuals who exercise regularly and those who don't, miRNAs could be a valuable aspect to consider in your project.

You might explore how exercise influences miRNA expression and, in turn, how these miRNAs might regulate genes related to BDNF and neuropsychiatric conditions. It's also interesting to note the potential of miRNAs as biomarkers for these conditions and their therapeutic implications.

Would you like to delve into specific miRNAs that have been associated with BDNF regulation, or discuss how you could incorporate miRNA analysis into your Capstone project methodology?

 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs, which function in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. They are powerful regulators of various cellular activities including cell growth, differentiation, development, and apoptosis. They have been linked to many diseases, and currently miRNA-mediated clinical trial has shown promising results for treatment of cancer and viral infection. This review provides an overview and update on miRNAs biogenesis, regulation of miRNAs expression, their biological functions, and role of miRNAs in epigenetics and cell–cell communication. In addition, alteration of miRNAs following exercise, their association with diseases, and therapeutic potential will be explained. Finally, miRNA bioinformatics tools and conventional methods for miRNA detection and quantification will be discussed.
