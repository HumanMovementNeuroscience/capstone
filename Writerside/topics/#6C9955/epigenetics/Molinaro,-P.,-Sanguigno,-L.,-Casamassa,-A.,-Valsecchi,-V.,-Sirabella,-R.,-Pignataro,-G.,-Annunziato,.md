## Basic Methodology
MORE INFORMATION NEEDED

## Detailed Summary
- DREAM is a [[Ca2+-sensitive protein]] with a dual mechanism affecting [[Ca2+-dependent processes]].
  - Upon [[sumoylation]], DREAM enters the nucleus to downregulate genes with a [[dream regulatory element (DRE)]].
  - Modulates activity/localization of cytosolic and plasma membrane proteins.
- Recent advances show DREAM dysregulation and DREAM-dependent [[epigenetic remodeling]] in central nervous system diseases.
  - Implicated in stroke, Alzheimer's, Huntington's diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and neuropathic pain.
  - Common detrimental role by inhibiting transcription of neuroprotective genes (e.g., NCX3, BDNF, pro-dynorphin, c-fos).
- DREAM as a potential [[pharmacological target]] for symptom amelioration and neurodegeneration reduction.

 Fascinating! This summary provides a comprehensive look at the role of DREAM in CNS diseases and its implications for gene expression. Given that your capstone project is exploring gene expression differences influenced by exercise, focusing on the DREAM protein and its regulatory effects on neuroprotective genes like BDNF could be a key aspect of your research.

Considering DREAM's role in downregulating genes critical for brain health, it might be worthwhile to explore how exercise-induced epigenetic modifications might counteract DREAM's effects. Here are a few points you could consider:

- **Mechanism of DREAM Action**: Understanding how DREAM's sumoylation and subsequent nuclear entry leads to gene downregulation could be vital. Establishing a link between this mechanism and exercise could provide insights into how physical activity could mitigate DREAM's negative effects.

- **DREAM and BDNF**: Since BDNF is one of the genes regulated by DREAM, and exercise is known to upregulate BDNF, investigating this relationship could be central to your thesis. You might want to explore how exercise affects DREAM's regulatory role on BDNF expression.

- **Therapeutic Potential**: The idea that DREAM could be a pharmacological target to improve symptoms in neurological diseases is intriguing. You could examine whether regular exercise, as a non-pharmacological intervention, might have similar benefits through its impact on DREAM and gene expression.

- **Comparative Studies**: You might consider proposing a study to compare the levels of DREAM, and its impact on gene expression, between individuals who exercise regularly and those who do not. This could provide concrete evidence of exercise's beneficial epigenetic influence.

 The downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator (DREAM) is a multifunctional Ca2+-sensitive protein exerting a dual mechanism of action to regulate several Ca2+-dependent processes. Upon sumoylation, DREAM enters in nucleus where it downregulates the expression of several genes provided with a consensus sequence named dream regulatory element (DRE). On the other hand, DREAM could also directly modulate the activity or the localization of several cytosolic and plasma membrane proteins. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the knowledge of DREAM dysregulation and DREAM-dependent epigenetic remodeling as a central mechanism in the progression of several diseases affecting central nervous system, including stroke, Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and neuropathic pain. Interestingly, DREAM seems to exert a common detrimental role in these diseases by inhibiting the transcription of several neuroprotective genes, including the sodium/calcium exchanger isoform 3 (NCX3), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), pro-dynorphin, and c-fos. These findings lead to the concept that DREAM might represent a pharmacological target to ameliorate symptoms and reduce neurodegenerative processes in several pathological conditions affecting central nervous system.
