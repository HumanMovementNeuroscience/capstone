 Hello! In this channel, we're focusing on how epigenetic mechanisms, like DNA methylation and histone modification, affect the expression of genes. Specifically, we're looking at genes that regulate Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and discussing their potential role in neuropsychiatric conditions, particularly in the context of individuals who exercise regularly versus those who don't. This discussion is directly related to your capstone project, which aims to explore these complex interactions and their implications for therapeutics. ðŸ§¬âœ¨
