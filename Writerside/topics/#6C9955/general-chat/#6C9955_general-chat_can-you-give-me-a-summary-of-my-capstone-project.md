 Consider including a review of current methodologies for measuring gene expression and a plan for how you'll evaluate the data you collect. Also, think about potential collaborations with experts in genetics or exercise physiology, which could enrich your project.

 is there anything else i should think about adding to my project?

 Absolutely, that makes perfect sense. Focusing on identifying gene targets related to exercise and BDNF can provide a solid foundation for future research, including the development of therapeutics. It's an essential step in the research process.

 i think i want to focus on the identification of gene targets instead of down the road things like translating the research into developing drugs or therapeutics, does that make sense?

 It could be valuable to start with the general impact of exercise on epigenetic changes, and as your research progresses, you may find it intriguing to delve into how different types of exercise might uniquely influence these changes. This layered approach can provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

 Should i focus on exercise in general or the difference between types of exercise on epigenetic changes?

 While BDNF is your primary focus due to its significant role in brain health and its potential upregulation through exercise, your exploration may extend to other related genes or factors as they pertain to neuropsychiatric conditions. It's about following the evidence where it leads within the scope of your project's goals.

 am I only focusing on BDNF?

 Certainly! Your capstone project focuses on investigating the gene expression differences related to the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) between individuals who regularly exercise and those who do not. You'll examine how these differences may influence neuropsychiatric conditions such as depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Your research will delve into epigenetics, the therapeutic benefits of exercise, and its implications for these disorders.
