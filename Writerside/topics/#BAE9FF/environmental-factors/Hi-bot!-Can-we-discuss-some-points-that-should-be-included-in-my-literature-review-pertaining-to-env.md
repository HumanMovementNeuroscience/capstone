 Certainly! While I can't provide direct links to resources, I can definitely guide you on where to find the information you're looking for. Research linking environmental factors to epigenetics and obesity is an emerging field, but here are some points to consider when looking for relevant literature:

- **Epigenetic changes**: Look for studies that discuss how specific environmental factors (like diet, pollutants, stress, etc.) can lead to epigenetic modifications.
- **Transgenerational effects**: Some studies explore how environmental factors can cause epigenetic changes that are passed down to subsequent generations and their relation to obesity.
- **Mechanisms of action**: Research often focuses on the mechanisms through which environmental factors can alter the epigenome, like DNA methylation, histone modification, or non-coding RNA.
- **Critical periods**: There is research on critical developmental periods (e.g., in utero, early childhood) where exposure to certain environmental factors might have long-lasting epigenetic effects related to obesity.

You'll want to search databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, and others for studies and reviews on these topics. Keywords you could use might include "environmental epigenetics," "obesity," "DNA methylation," and "transgenerational inheritance."

If you need help with refining your search strategy or accessing specific databases, let me know!

 Can you point to anything direvtly linking environmental factors to epigenetics?

 Hi there! Absolutely, discussing your literature review on environmental factors and their influence on obesity is a great place to start. When considering what to include, you might want to look at:

- **Historical context**: How have environmental factors historically been linked to obesity?
- **Current understanding**: What does current research say about the connection?
- **Methodologies**: What methods are used to study the impact of environmental factors on obesity?
- **Key findings**: What are some of the significant discoveries in this area?
- **Gaps in research**: Are there areas that are under-researched or have conflicting data?
- **Future directions**: Based on current findings, where is this research heading?

Remember to look for peer-reviewed articles, reputable journals, and current statistics. If you need help accessing resources or refining your search, I'm here to assist!
