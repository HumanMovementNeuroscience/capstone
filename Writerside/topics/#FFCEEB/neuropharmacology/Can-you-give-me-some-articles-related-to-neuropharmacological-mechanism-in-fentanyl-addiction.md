 Absolutely, I can guide you to some resources that you may find helpful for understanding the neuropharmacological mechanisms of fentanyl addiction. Here's a brief list to get you started:

- **"Fentanyl: The new wave of opioid addiction"** - This article can provide an overview of how fentanyl addiction occurs and its impact on the brain's neurochemistry.
- **"Neuropharmacologic mechanisms of drug reward: Beyond dopamine in the nucleus accumbens"** - Although this article is not specific to fentanyl, it offers an in-depth look at the neuropharmacological pathways involved in drug addiction.
- **"The Pharmacology of Fentanyl and Other Synthetic Opioids"** - This research paper details the specific pharmacological properties of fentanyl and how it interacts with opioid receptors in the brain.

Remember, accessing these articles may require institutional or library access. If you have trouble finding them, I can help you with strategies to access academic papers. Would you like assistance with that?
