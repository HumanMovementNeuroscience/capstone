**Guidelines for faculty research consultant meetings and reports**

**Note: don't delay contacting your consultant!** They are
[not]{.underline} expecting to read a finished proposal -- they will
help you get there!

**SCHEDULING YOUR FIRST MEETING**

Don't expect an immediate reply -- if you haven't heard anything after a
few days, try again.

**Email subject line:** Request for Capstone consultant meeting.

Body of email:

-   Introduce yourself

-   Include your schedule -- when you have class or other inflexible
    commitments, and when are good times for you to meet. Phone and
    video meetings are fine (not email).

-   Attach your most recent draft, along with questions you would like
    to discuss (see below for ideas). You can wait to send these until a
    week before you meet.

**BEFORE MEETING**

Write several questions that you would like to address with your
consultant. Consider which parts of your proposal you feel may need
work. Your consultant will be most helpful if your questions are
**specific**.

**POSSIBLE TOPICS TO DISCUSS DURING THE MEETING**

There are no requirements on what you discuss when you meet. Below are
some questions that you might consider addressing.

-   Is the general purpose of the study described briefly, but
    understandably?

-   Are the arguments for the importance of this research clear (is the
    background sufficient to understand the importance of the proposed
    work)?

-   Are the specific aims and objectives clearly stated, including an
    explicit hypothesis?

-   Are the aims too vague or too narrow? Are the aims feasible?

-   Identify strengths of the proposal or ideas that are particularly
    interesting.

-   Identify areas in need of work. Are there problems with the aims?
    What ideas need more thought or support from the literature?

**SUMMARY OF MEETING -- you must submit a report of your meeting to get
credit for it.** Take notes during the meeting if you can. Then sit down
and write out what you discussed. **Include the following in your
report:**

-   Your name.

-   Your consultant's name.

-   The questions that you prepared before the meeting.

-   The date and time that you met (in-person or, more likely,
    virtually).

-   The ideas that you discussed during the meeting.

-   Any ideas that came up for preparing for your second meeting, if
    there will be one.

Submit this report to Canvas. Ideally, you should submit this report
within a week of your meeting, but I will accept it any time before the
end of the semester.

**Remember to send an email to your consultant(s) thanking them for
their time!**
