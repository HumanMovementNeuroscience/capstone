**Tips for effective presentations**

You will have 15 minutes to present and to answer questions.

***[Content to include in your presentation]{.underline} (in this
order)***

1.  Title slide including your name.

2.  **Background** -- start with the big picture and include a
    discussion of previous research.

3.  **Hypothesis** (or hypotheses) and a list of your **specific aims**.

4.  At least a general description of **research design** (you don't
    have to have everything worked out yet).

**Note: you do not need a literature cited slide, though you may include
one if you wish.**

***[Presentation Tips]{.underline}***

-   A useful rule of thumb is to make 1 slide for each minute of the
    talk. In this case, a 15-minute talk with questions means you should
    present 12-13 slides.

-   Face your audience, make eye contact and speak clearly at a moderate
    pace. **Try to sound interested** in what you are talking about --
    if you're not interested, your audience probably won't be either!

-   As you move from point to point on a slide, you can use a laser
    pointer to direct the audience's attention, but never wave the
    pointer around your slide! At best, it will only distract the
    audience.

-   **Avoid jargon**. You are speaking to a biology-literate audience,
    but not one that is knowledgeable about your specific field. Explain
    (or avoid) abbreviations and specialized terminology.

-   **End your talk gracefully**. Prepare the listeners that you are
    wrapping up. Some useful phrases: "In conclusion," "I'd like to make
    one final point," "Before I end I'd like to emphasize the
    importance..." Then finish with something like **"Thank you. I'd be
    happy to answer any questions."**

-   Practice, practice, practice. You should **speak your presentation
    out loud** before you're in front of an audience -- don't get caught
    fumbling over a word you don't know how to pronounce!

***[Slides]{.underline}***

-   Be selective about what details you want to present visually and
    which to elaborate on orally.

-   Short phrases are preferable to long sentences.

-   Restrict the amount of text on your slides. If you have a lot to
    say, make a second slide. Use bullets to separate your points.
    ***Never read summary slides verbatim***.

-   If you have graphs, **take the time to orient the audience** to
    them. Describe what is on the axes or column headings, and then
    **interpret the data** for the audience. Give them a take-home
    message.

***[Colors]{.underline}***

-   **Few color combinations work well in slides.** Remember to maintain
    a **high contrast** between the font and the background and consider
    a color-blind friendly palette. Any background picture needs to be
    subtle (you can often adjust the transparency, making a bold picture
    softer).

-   Once you have developed a color scheme, use it consistently for all
    slides.

***[Answering questions]{.underline}***

-   **Paraphrase questions before answering**, especially if other
    audience members may not have heard them (this practice also gives
    you time to formulate your answer!).

-   Feel free to ask for clarification if you do not understand a
    question.

-   Do not be afraid to admit that you don't know the answer to a
    question -- there are many ways to do so knowledgeably. For example,
    the answers to many questions are not yet known (hence, research).
