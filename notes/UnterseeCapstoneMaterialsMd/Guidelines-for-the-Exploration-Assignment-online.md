**Guidelines for the Exploration Assignment**

**Objective:** To learn more about a career or field of professional
interest to you. You aren't expected to do all options -- read each to
see how much each would count for.

**Options (these must be events or activities that you did this
semester):**

1.  Write reports on research presentations. Though there are many at
    Northeastern, you are not limited to these talks. Check for "Events"
    at the homepage of departments in any university. You may also watch
    recorded webinars (though try to find recent talks). The number of
    talks depends on their length -- total time should be 2 hours (for
    example, 4 half-hour talks). The research can be in any field that
    is of professional interest to you (unlike the extra credit
    assignment, which needs to be science based).

2.  Write reports on a career talk. I am open to a variety of formats
    (panel discussions, presentations, question and answer) so long as
    the people involved are working in the field they are representing
    (not simply someone from Career Services). This option is worth ½ of
    the assignment even if it is over an hour in length (though you
    could report on two different career panels to fulfill the entire
    assignment).

3.  Write reports on the interactive training videos available online
    from the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) designed to
    educate new researchers about requirements for research involving
    human subjects (<https://ori.hhs.gov/research-clinic>) or about
    research misconduct (<https://ori.hhs.gov/the-lab>). There are 4
    roles to explore in each set of videos; you should watch videos for
    each of the roles. Reports on each set of videos satisfy ½ of the
    assignment, so you can watch one set and do something else, or
    report on both sets to complete the exploration assignment.

4.  You may report on TED talks (any topic) and podcasts of academic
    journals (e.g., Science) for ½ of this assignment (e.g., multiple
    TED talks $\cong$ 1 hour) with the other half based on another
    option. Include the length for each TED talk or podcast.

5.  I am open to other possibilities that meet the objective. If you
    have an idea that doesn't match any I've listed, email me a link or
    pdf with information about the activity. I will let you know if the
    activity is acceptable, and, if so, how much of the assignment it is
    worth.

**Not options** -- activities related to interviewing or applying for
jobs or schools.

**Formatting**

-   Cover page (see below -- all reports should be submitted as 1 file)

-   Approximately ½-1 page per report, double-spaced, 1" margins all
    around, 12-point font, pdf.

-   Content may be what you learned, what was interesting or confusing.
    Length is unimportant; convince me that you did what you are
    reporting on and that your brain was active.

**Cover page (can be 1 for all reports or 1 for each, it's up to you)**

-   Your name

-   The option(s) you chose to complete this assignment

-   The date(s) on which you attended the talk (discussion, interview,
    etc.)

-   A short explanation of why you were interested in the talks,
    seminars, or interviewee
