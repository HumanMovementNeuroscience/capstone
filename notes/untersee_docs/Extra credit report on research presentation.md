Research presentation extra credit assignment

Similar to the exploration assignment, you may get extra credit for
reporting on a talk about research (it can be in any field of science).
Submitting this report by the end of the semester will earn you +1% on
your final grade. You may only submit one report for extra credit, and
it may not be the same as one used for the Exploration assignment.

Since finding talks to attend is difficult most summers, and likely
impossible now, I will accept reports on pre-recorded webinars or
webcasts of research talks.

Write a page summarizing what the speaker discussed. Don't feel that you
have to understand it all -- you may include questions that you had
during the talk or parts of the talk that confused you. Make sure to
include the following information:

-   Name of the speaker

-   Affiliated institution (*e.g.*, Northeastern University)

-   Date and place of the talk (or URL)

-   General summary of the talk

I only create Canvas submission portals for mandatory assignments, so
you should email this report directly to me.
