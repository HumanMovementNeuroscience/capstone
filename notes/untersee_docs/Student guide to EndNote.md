# Student Guide to EndNote

## Getting the software

Obtain free EndNote software by logging into your student hub and
clicking on "Resources." Then, under "Software and IT Support" click
"Software downloads." The latest version available is 20, but I would
recommend downloading X9 until more resources are available for 20.

You must install EndNote [after]{.underline} installing Word, so if you
reinstall Word, reinstall EndNote. Your EndNote library will be saved,
so don't worry about losing information. Full instructions can be found
at: <https://subjectguides.lib.neu.edu/bio/endnote>.

**(Note: I do [not]{.underline} recommend creating an online EndNote
account.)**

## Short videos for starting with EndNote (short, but extremely useful!)

If you have never used EndNote, I recommend watching one of these
6-minute videos:

For Apple OS: EndNote X9: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt-Fv3eP_aY>

EndNote 20: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUmAWEW6pBc>

For Windows: EndNote X9:
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e6-6QkcYm0&t=2s>

EndNote 20: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg613wuctoM>

These videos include instructions for:

-   Creating your EndNote library

-   Importing references from an online database

-   Creating a custom group and adding references to it

-   How to insert a reference in a Word document

-   How to format a bibliography

-   How to add page numbers to an in-text citation

And more!

**Getting references into your library**

> **If you found the article in a database**

-   Download a file to import into your EndNote library (see video
    above).

-   This method is especially efficient if you want to import several
    references at once.

> **If you have the pdf -- import it directly**

-   If a URL is added for where you got the pdf -- delete this in
    EndNote.

-   If most information is missing, delete the reference and try another
    method.

> **If pdf import doesn't work, use the online search mode within
> EndNote**

-   I recommend searching using an author with an uncommon name, the
    year, and an unusual word from the title. If you don't get any
    sources, make sure you have spelled everything correctly, or try
    leaving out the year.

-   Then select the articles you want and click the plus sign above the
    list on the right.

**These three modes are all you need for journal articles. For other
sources, add them manually. See "Advanced tips" and "Further resources"
below or schedule time with me.**

**Advanced tips**

**Citing websites with EndNote (not covered in videos above)**

You cannot import websites to EndNote without an online account, so
enter them manually. Check out this video:
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMZzzQdIQDI> (the whole video is almost
15 minutes long, but you only need to see the first 5 minutes for
webpages) or follow these directions.

1.  On the "References" menu, select "New reference."

2.  The default reference type is "Journal article" so first change it
    to "Webpage" (look for the tiny dropdown menu in the top left
    corner).

3.  If there is no individual author, use the organization that
    maintains the website (e.g., the Centers for Disease Control). **To
    avoid formatting issues, add a comma at the end of the organization
    name in EndNote**.

4.  The only information you need to enter for APA 7^th^ edition style:

    a.  author,

    b.  the most recent update year, if given (if not, enter "n.d." for
        "no date"),

    c.  title of the webpage, and

    d.  the year and date you accessed the page (list both in "access
        date")

    e.  the URL.

**Adding citations to your document** ([do not copy and
paste]{.underline} or use online citation generators)

-   Working in Word, find the EndNote toolbar (it can take time to
    appear the first time you use it. Be patient, especially if you have
    an older computer).

-   On this toolbar, click on "Insert citation." Your EndNote library
    should open (you may have to locate it the first time you do this)
    and you can search for the article you want.

-   Select one or more articles to cite, and then hit "Insert."

**Changing your bibliography style**

-   Select "Configure bibliography" (on PCs, click the arrow by
    "Bibliography") and then "Layout" to make sure the font and line
    spacing match the rest of your document.

-   Sometimes when your source is missing the "doi" EndNote will instead
    use the URL which is not correct (only use URLs for websites). An
    easy fix is to clear the URL field for the given reference in the
    EndNote program.

1.  The company that makes EndNote has extensive training videos at
    [http://clarivate.libguides.com/EndNote_training/users](http://clarivate.libguides.com/endnote_training/users)
    on a wide variety of beginner to advanced topics. Many of these
    videos are short (around 5 minutes) and address specific questions
    or problems you run into.

2.  The NU Library has a help page at
    <http://subjectguides.lib.neu.edu/EndNote> with troubleshooting
    notes and links to EndNote support and video tutorials.

3.  If you have questions about whether EndNote is properly formatting
    according to APA 6^th^ or 7^th^ edition style, check Purdue's Online
    Writing Laboratory for info on this style
    (<https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html>).
