**Guidelines for Proposal First Draft**

As the first of three drafts, writing from this one may be used
word-for-word in later drafts.

**Objectives**

-   To give a general description of your proposed research, so that I
    can judge whether it sounds reasonable, and you are moving in a
    direction and at a pace to succeed.

-   To begin putting your ideas together in a form that will be the
    basis for your finished proposal. Write in a style that is
    professional, while not worrying too much about details. I expect
    changes in future drafts based on feedback (from me, your peers, and
    others) and your own continued thinking and reading (and reading and
    reading...).

**Content** (don't worry about sections -- you will use them in the next
draft)

-   Include **a working descriptive title** (don't obsess over it --
    good titles are tough!).

-   A description of the **general topic**. Begin with **the big
    picture** (not your proposed work). To get your audience interested,
    give evidence for **the importance of your research.**

-   Explain the **background** for your research.

    -   What is **already known**? What have **others done**? Describe
        previous research (some in detail, some more generally,
        depending on relevance to your work).

    -   What **remains to be discovered** (focus on what you are
        proposing)?

-   A **clear statement of the problem you plan to address.**

-   An **explicit statement of your hypothesis (you need to use the word
    "hypothesis")**.

-   Some ideas for **how you propose to address this problem**. It is
    likely you are still working out your methods -- explain as much as
    you can at this point.

-   Explain **how your proposed research will add to what is known**
    about this topic.

-   **Cite a minimum of 5 reliable sources** (aim for 10+), mostly
    peer-reviewed articles.

**Format**

1.  **Double space with 1-inch margins all around** and a **12-point
    font**.

2.  Use **first-line indent** for paragraphs, with no blank line between
    paragraphs.

3.  I grade based on content, not length. However, to meet the
    expectations of this assignment, your paper should be **a minimum of
    2 double-spaced pages (aim for 4)**.

4.  Try to be **clear and concise**. I won't be too particular about
    grammar and spelling unless it impedes understanding. I will look
    for wordiness, awkward sentences, run-on sentences, and improper
    word choice.

5.  **Write in a tone appropriate for formal scientific writing**. You
    may include parenthetical notes to tell me about points that you are
    still working out, and these parenthetical asides may be more
    informal. The body of the work, however, should be written formally
    (*i.e.*, no slang, clich√©s, hyperbole, colloquial phrasing, or
    contractions).

6.  **Convert the file to a pdf before submitting**.

7.  Cite using **APA 6^th^ or 7^th^ edition citation style using
    reference software** (e.g., EndNote, see information on Canvas). You
    may use other software, but not all are good (**do not** use
    websites or suggestions from the library website. These may be
    wrong).

**I do not provide a grading rubric ahead of time, but I create one
based on the contents of these guidelines, so follow them closely.**
