**Preparing your final draft**

**Check all previous guidelines.** Also, check the peer review
guidelines -- review your own proposal using these same guidelines. The
only new part for this draft is the budget (see separate guidelines).

For advanced tips, check the "Tips for effective science writing" file!

The order and titles for the sections of the proposal should be as
follows:

> **Title page**
>
> page break (meaning the next section should start on a new page)
>
> **Specific Aims & Objectives**
>
> **Background & Significance**
>
> **Research Design** (these 3 sections can flow continuously from one
> page to the next)
>
> page break
>
> **Budget and Budget Justification**
>
> page break
>
> **References**

I have not specified formatting for section headings, but they should
stand out clearly, and appear more major than sub-headings. The aims,
background, and design can start directly after the preceding sections.
Add page breaks as needed to make transitions look professional.

Below are some areas that will have increased weight or are different
from previous drafts.

Content:

> I will expect a plethora of citations (not in the Specific Aims). **At
> least 15 but aim for 25-30.**
>
> **Working hypothesis must be stated in the Specific Aims section** and
> should **precede** the statement of the aims. It may be in Background
> but is not necessary in that section.
>
> Add the budget.
>
> Anticipated results in Research Design **(make sure you address all
> possible outcomes)**.

Formatting:

> **Use the same formatting given in previous guidelines (double space,
> etc.).**
>
> **Remember, the Specific Aims & Objectives section should have no
> citations.** Similar statements in the background should still have
> citations -- this convention is used to make the Specific Aims section
> easier to read.
>
> Page numbers (make sure you have them -- it's okay if "1" appears on
> the title page).
>
> **Precise formatting for the References section and in-text
> citations** in accordance with APA 6^th^ or 7^th^ edition style (don't
> worry about doi's). Do not rely entirely on EndNote to format
> non-journal sources. Check Purdue's Online Writing Laboratory (OWL)
> for a summary of this style (look on Canvas in the module "Useful
> Online Resources").
>
> Title page in exact format given (available on Canvas as a Word
> document -- you can change the institution and logo if you'd like).

Grammar:

> **Typographical errors/spelling** (I expect much higher attention to
> detail in this final draft!).
>
> Awkward sentences and run-on sentences.

Flow and logic:

> Wordiness, redundancy, unnecessary repetition, writing the same thing
> repeatedly (aren't I funny?).
>
> Smooth transitions from sentence to sentence, paragraph to paragraph,
> and section to section.
