**Guidelines for the Informational Interview**

**Objective:** To learn more about a career or field of interest to you.

Report on an informational interview with someone working in a career or
field of interest to you. Check this webpage at Career Services for
help:
(https://careers.northeastern.edu/article/informational-interviewing/).

**Content for report**

-   Your name

-   The name of the person you interviewed

-   The date on which the interview took place

-   How you conducted the interview (in person, by phone, Zoom,
    FaceTime, etc. -- note that an email exchange is
    **[not]{.underline}** an interview)

-   List the questions you prepared before the interview

-   Discuss some of what you talked about (which may or may not align
    with your prepared questions!)

-   Discuss what you learned about the career or field (you don't have
    to be overly thorough -- discuss what you found interesting or what
    surprised you)

**Formatting for report** (honestly, I'm not overly strict about this)

-   About 1 page

-   Double-spaced

-   1" margins all around

-   12-point font

-   Converted to pdf
