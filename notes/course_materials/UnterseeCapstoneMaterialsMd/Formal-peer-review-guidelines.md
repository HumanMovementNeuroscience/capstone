**PEER REVIEW GUIDELINES**

Find the proposal assigned to you on Canvas (in the assignment "Second
draft"). I recommend that you read everything, taking notes as you go,
before writing your review. **Type your comments in a document [with the
author's name at the top]{.underline}, using the [exact]{.underline}
headings given below (the headings are capitalized).** As an anonymous
reviewer you do not have to include your name. **Submit as a pdf.**

Length (your writing): **\~2-3 single-spaced pages** (with blank lines
between sections). You don't need to answer every question listed here.
Address [**everything** in **boldface**]{.underline}, and **some of the
other questions**.

**Be critical, constructive, and thorough.** Be tactful, but helpful --
your goal is not to make the author feel good (or bad), but to improve
the proposal. **Provide specific examples to support your statements.**

A.  **OVERALL QUALITY: Does the proposal make sense and look
    professional? Provide specific suggestions where improvements should
    be made, or which sections require the most work.**

-   Do you, at any point (be specific) struggle to understand what the
    author is trying to say?

-   Does each paragraph have a clear point, and do paragraphs and
    sentences flow logically? Are any sections too short or long? Is the
    tone professional, avoiding clich√©s and conversational phrases?

-   Is the draft at any point plagued by typos, poor grammar, or awkward
    phrasing?

B.  **SPECIFIC AIMS: Explain the goals of this study. If you cannot,
    provide specific suggestions for improvement.**

-   **Is the working hypothesis stated explicitly? Does it make sense
    based on previous statements?**

-   Are the objectives (means by which the aims will be accomplished)
    stated clearly?

C.  **BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE: Explain why this project is worth
    doing, particularly in comparison to what has already been done or
    discovered.**

-   The beginning should address the scope of the research (the "big
    picture"). Why would anyone care to fund your research? If you can
    pitch your research to a wide audience, you have a much better
    chance of getting funding! **Is the "big picture" too narrow or too
    vague?**

-   **Is the background presented clearly and logically**, with
    appropriate sub-headings (logically ordered, not too many
    sub-headings, and all with informative subtitles)?

-   **Does the author interpret and explain past research or simply
    present findings?**

-   **Is the background information sufficient to determine how previous
    research has led to the proposed research? How does the proposed
    work expand on what has been done?**

-   **Has the author provided some type of [concluding
    statement]{.underline} that summarizes what the proposed research
    will accomplish (what specific progress will be made toward the
    larger goals)?**

D.  **RESEARCH DESIGN: Does the research design address all proposed
    specific aims? Is it clear how the methods address the specific aims
    and hypotheses? Are outcomes discussed?**

-   Are enough details given so you can understand the proposed methods,
    at least generally?

-   Is the reasoning for choosing methods or organisms or techniques
    clear and logical?

-   **Are all possible outcomes addressed?** Are potential problems
    discussed? Are you satisfied with explanations for both outcomes and
    potential problems? If not, what needs to be addressed?

E.  **REFERENCES:**

-   **Are the sources appropriate for a science proposal? Do they seem
    reliable and up-to-date?**

-   Comment on a few statements you think need a citation (or more
    citations).

-   Does the author ever cite multiple sources for one statement? If so,
    is this common or rare?

-   **Do citations follow APA 6^th^ or 7^th^ edition style (in-text and
    in the References section)?**
