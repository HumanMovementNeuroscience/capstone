## Part 1 - Intro to the course
### Course Structure

- Shared and Individividual categories
#### The Bot
- Heirarchical prompt structure based on
  - Top-level bot-instructions channel
  - Catergory level bot-instructions channel\
  - Channel topic description
- It makes things up! Be wary!
 
### Course Philosophy
#### "Formative pedagogy" approach
- Build the boat while sailing it
- Your job - Do your project
- My job - Manage the course-level stuff
#### Ai-enabled Flexibility
- The bot will help wrangle each of you individually 
- This allows for a much greater degree of flexibility than a traditional course
- Might feel weird at first, but trust the process
#### Outcomes over grades
- De-emphasizing grades
- Just do the assignments
- Focus on your Capstone project
- Your pride in your work is determinant of your success

## Part 2 Activities
### Capstone Project
- Individually developed by each student
- Will follow a general timeline with checkpoints
- Main outcome will be some kind of written document
  - Default plan: An NIH-style grant proposal
  - Alternative plan: A research paper
  - ...or anything else you can convince me is a good idea
### Interim Assignments
- Individual assignments
- Group assignments
- Peer Reviews

## Assignment #1-introductions
### Instructions
- Go to the #1-introductions channel of the |--ASSIGNMENTSðŸ“ƒ--| Category
- Enter `/chat ` in the chat input box at the bottom of the screen, input some starting text (like a simple "hello" is fine), and press Enter
- Chat with the bot for a bit about anything you want
- Feel free to open as many chats as you want

#### The Point
- Ultimately, the chats themselves don't mean anything (other than what you get out of them )
- The actual goal is to get a bunch of test that is relvant to your interests into the server 
- *YOU* will use these initial conversations to start mapping out your capstone
- *I* will use the accumulation of your conversations to start mapping out inter-relationships between your chosen topics
