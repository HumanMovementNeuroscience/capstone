## Course Description 

Capstone is an opportunity for you to reflect on your progress towards
becoming a professional in biology, cell and molecular biology,
biochemistry, behavioral neuroscience, or marine biology and to think
ahead towards how you might use this training in your career and your
personal life. No matter what you end up doing, at some point you will
need to write persuasively with support from reliable sources. To
practice these skills and to learn standards used in scientific writing,
assignments will focus on producing a grant proposal in a format like
that used by the National Institutes of Health.

## Course Goals
The goals of the course are for you to: 
1. Hone your critical thinking
and persuasive writing skills; 
1. practice your public speaking or
interview skills; and 
1.  demonstrate your knowledge of the conventions
used by biologists in writing and discussing research. 

## Writing Intensive

Biology Capstone fulfills the Northeastern requirement for a
writing-intensive course in the major for Biology, Biochemistry,
Behavioral Neurosciences, Cell and Molecular Biology or Marine Biology.
As such, it includes frequent and regular writing, assessment and
revision of student work, and the opportunity for students to improve
their work.

## Course Policies

### Online participation

As an online course, we do not meet as a group, however you are strongly
encouraged to meet with me individually when you can (in person or via
Zoom). You are expected to post comments and questions to Canvas
discussion groups and to share work and comments on peer work, all of
which will be used to determine your online participation. You are
encouraged to post even if you miss a deadline -- these posts will be
counted as late, but that's better than never!

### Inclusion, diversity, and Title IX

I value the diversity of students at Northeastern and strive to create a
climate of inclusion for all regardless of background, country of
origin, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or
disability status. If there are aspects of your culture or identity
that you would like to share with me as they relate to your success in
this class, I would be happy to meet with you. Also, if you have any
concerns or are facing any special issues or challenges, I encourage you
to discuss the matter with me as you feel comfortable. Keep in mind,
however, that faculty members are considered "responsible employees" at
Northeastern University, meaning we are required to report allegations
of sex or gender-based discrimination to the Title IX Coordinator. For
additional information and assistance please see the Office of
Institutional Diversity and Inclusion webpage
(<https://provost.northeastern.edu/oidi/>).

### Academic honesty

Don't claim another human's work as your own. 

Other than that, you cannot cheat in this class. 

### Communication 

//communicate via Discord, email, or Canvas

### Assignment submissions

//Assignments on a recommended schedule, bot will help you keep track of your progress

### Grading and feedback

I will do my best to provide assignment grades in a timely manner. While
your life as a student has trained you to focus on grades, it's time to
break this training. For most jobs, feedback is qualitative, not
quantitative. Pay close attention to the guidelines I provide and the
feedback that you get from me and your peers, and a good grade should
follow!
