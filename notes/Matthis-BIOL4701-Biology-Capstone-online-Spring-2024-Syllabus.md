## Course Policies

### Writing Intensive

Biology Capstone fulfills the Northeastern requirement for a
writing-intensive course in the major for Biology, Biochemistry,
Behavioral Neurosciences, Cell and Molecular Biology or Marine Biology.
As such, it includes frequent and regular writing, assessment and
revision of student work, and the opportunity for students to improve
their work.

### Inclusion, diversity, and Title IX

I value the diversity of students at Northeastern and strive to create a
climate of inclusion for all regardless of background, country of
origin, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or
disability status. If there are aspects of your culture or identity
that you would like to share with me as they relate to your success in
this class, I would be happy to meet with you. Also, if you have any
concerns or are facing any special issues or challenges, I encourage you
to discuss the matter with me as you feel comfortable. Keep in mind,
however, that faculty members are considered "responsible employees" at
Northeastern University, meaning we are required to report allegations
of sex or gender-based discrimination to the Title IX Coordinator. For
additional information and assistance please see the Office of
Institutional Diversity and Inclusion webpage
(<https://provost.northeastern.edu/oidi/>).

### Academic honesty

Don't claim another human's work as your own. 

Other than that, you cannot cheat in this class.
