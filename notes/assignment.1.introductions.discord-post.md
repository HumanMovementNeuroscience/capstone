# Assignment-1-introductions-discord-post


Hey @everyone - Welcome to this weird class! 

I'll post a video with much more information soon, but in the mean time go ahead and: 

- Go to the #1-introductions channel of the |--ASSIGNMENTSðŸ“ƒ--| Category, and 

- Enter `/chat ` in the chat input box at the bottom of the screen, input some starting text (like a simple "hello" is fine), and press Enter

- Chat with the bot for a bit about anything you want 

Ultimately, the chats themselves don't matter, you goal is mostly to **get the bot to talk about things related to the kinds of things you might want to do for your capstone project** 

(I'll share more info about the exact nature of that project soon - don't worry about the details for now, just brainstorm on general topics/areas of interest)

TIPS - 
- The bot is running `gpt-4-1106-preview` under the hood, 
- It's an AI, so it'll get things wrong and make stuff up sometimes 
- Try copy-pasting paper abstracts into the chat 
- It'll probably break. Maybe a lot. It's fine - just ping me @jonmatthis if it goes down completely
- You can make as many `/chat` threads as you want. Go to town!
- Have fun!
