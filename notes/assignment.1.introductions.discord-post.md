# Assignment-1-introductions-discord-post


Hey @everyone - Welcome to this weird class! 

I'll post a video with much more information soon, but in the mean time go ahead and: 

- Go to the #1-introductions channel of the |--ASSIGNMENTSðŸ“ƒ--| Category, and 

- Enter `/chat ` in the chat input box at the bottom of the screen, input some starting text (like a simple "hello" is fine), and press Enter

- Chat with the bot for a bit about anything you want 

Ultimately, the chats themselves don't mean anything (other than what you get out of them )
