## Course Description 
In this capstone course, you (the student reading this) will create a unique project that showcases and hones the techincal skills and intellectual interests.

This project represents the culmination of your undergraduate career, and will serve an an opportunity to reflect on your undergraduate experience and hone the skills that will allow you transition into the next phase of your life (whatever that might be).

You will be the driver of the specific content and structure of your Capstone project, which will be designed to showcase your ability to indepently explore an intellectual space/topic, form your own assessment of the landscape, limitations, and gaps of the current human understand of your chosen domain of inquiry, and then communicate/present those thoughts to a wider audience.

### Course Goals
In this course, each student will: 
- Develop, create, plan, execute their own Capstone project
- Engage and other students' as they work their own projects, and receive assistance from their peers
- Learn modern tools for:
  - Knowledge base development
  - Document generation
  - Asynchronous and decentralized project management

### Course structure
This class will happen on a Discord server with configurable [AI bot](#classbot) that will assist each student with the development and management of their capstone project.

#### Discord
- Discord is a chat application that allows for text, voice, and video communication.
- This course will be primarily run through Discord (and the Ai Bot that lives there)


#### ClassBot
  - ClassBot - A configured instance of [SkellyBot](https://github.com/freemocap/skellybot)

## Course Policies

### Writing Intensive

Biology Capstone fulfills the Northeastern requirement for a
writing-intensive course in the major for Biology, Biochemistry,
Behavioral Neurosciences, Cell and Molecular Biology or Marine Biology.
As such, it includes frequent and regular writing, assessment and
revision of student work, and the opportunity for students to improve
their work.

### Inclusion, diversity, and Title IX

I value the diversity of students at Northeastern and strive to create a
climate of inclusion for all regardless of background, country of
origin, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or
disability status. If there are aspects of your culture or identity
that you would like to share with me as they relate to your success in
this class, I would be happy to meet with you. Also, if you have any
concerns or are facing any special issues or challenges, I encourage you
to discuss the matter with me as you feel comfortable. Keep in mind,
however, that faculty members are considered "responsible employees" at
Northeastern University, meaning we are required to report allegations
of sex or gender-based discrimination to the Title IX Coordinator. For
additional information and assistance please see the Office of
Institutional Diversity and Inclusion webpage
(<https://provost.northeastern.edu/oidi/>).

### Academic honesty

Don't claim another human's work as your own. 

Other than that, far as I can figure, there is no way to cheat in this class.
