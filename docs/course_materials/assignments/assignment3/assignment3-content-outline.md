# Assignment3 - Building your workspace 

## Intro
### Meta chat about the course
- its hard to teach a class in how to write a grant proposal or whatever when the fundamental tools that I use to do that changed dramatically recently 
- so, like, I'm trying to teach you how to do something that I am currently figuring out how to do myself. 
- updates to the syllanus
- added `#important links` channel
- give some info about the expectations for the capstone project
  - Especially w.r.t.
    - citation stuff
    - the actual document guidelines
- Talk about the general timelines expected (in the syllabus)
- Also do the FreeMoCap disclosure thing explicitly
