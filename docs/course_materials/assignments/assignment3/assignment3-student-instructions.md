# Assignment 3 - Your Space



### Background 
- You now have a category in the server dedicated you and your capstone project!
- It is named something like `#FF00FF` 
  - i.e. the unique hex code you made when you signed up
  - Botto should've probably DM'd your ID to you if you forgot it 
- You have full control within your category to make channels and configure them as you like!
   - NOTE - If I have configured this correctly, 
      - You should have full control within your category, but OTHER students will only have 'view' access, not 'write' access

### Task       
#### Step 1 - set up your space



```
# Brief project description
{1-2 sentences about what you want to focus on for your capstone project}

## Topic Area #1

## Topic Area #2

## Topic Area #3
```

The working title and major topics should be a few words each, 1 sentence tops.

For example, 

#### Step 2 - Make a channel for each topic
- Make a channel for each major topic in your space
  - Click the plus sign next to the category name to make a new channel
  - Name the channel after the major topic
  - Click the Edit Channel button and add some more detail about the topic and how it relates to your project/intests
    - Use the `#general-chat` channel to have conversations outside of any of these topics
    - Use that area to draft and hone text you are using in the different categories


---
##### Option 1 - Use the bot
- Go back and extract summaries from your previous conversations about the topics you want to do your capstone about (or ignore them and start from scratch if you want - truly doesn't matter).
  - Extract a short summary of your project. It should fit within a single discord message (so ~2000 characters) and be of the form

##### Option 2 - Do it yourself, manually
- Just, like, write yourself
  - Pro: You get to write exactly the words you want
  - Cons: You have the words yourself. 

##### Option 3 (aka the smart move) - Do both 
- Use the bot to help you get started, and then edit the text it produces so it ACTUALLY fits what you want it to say
