# Assignment 3 - Your Space

### You now have a category in the server dedicated your capstone project!
- It is named something like `#FF00FF` - i.e. the unique hex code you made when you signed up
  - Botto should've probably DM'd your ID to you if you forgot it 
- You have full control within your category to make channels and configure them as you like!

### Task
#### Step 1 - set up your space
- Go back and extract summaries from your previous conversations about the topics you want to do your capstone about (or ignore them and start from scratch if you want - truly doesn't matter).
- Extract a short summary of your project. It should fit within a signle discord message (so ~2000 characters) and be of the form: 


```
# Working title  

## Major Topic 1 
## Major Topic 2
## Major Topic 3

``` 

The working title and major topics should be a few words each, 1 sentence tops.

#### Step 2 - Make a channel for each topic
- Make a channel for each major topic in your space
  - Click the plus sign next to the category name to make a new channel
  - Name the channel after the major topic
  - Click the Edit Channel button and add some more detail about the topic and how it relates to your project/intests
    - Use the `#general-chat` channel to have conversations outside of any of these topics
    - Use that area to draft and hone text you are using in the different categories
