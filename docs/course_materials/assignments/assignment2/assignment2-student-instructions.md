# Exercise 2 - Article Summary Extraction  

### 1. Go into the #2-paper-summary-extraction (https://discord.com/channels/1194766712680222800/1200118663043371088) channel, pop open a `/chat` and talk to the bot about some paper or another on any topic that you are interested in (i.e. roughly related to your hypothetical capstone topic)

### 2. Be sure to copy-paste  the **full citation** (it should have either a `doi` or `PMID` in it)  in the chat somewhere. You can also copy-paste the paper abstract as well to kickstart things. 

### 3. Once you've had a bit of a chat about it, copy the prompt I put in the top of that channel into your chat and see what it produces (Tweak the prompt as needed to get the results you want!) 

### 4. Check the output! Is the summary good? Did the AI a good job? If not, try tweaking the prompt a bit and see if you can get it to do better (heck, do that anyway!).

### 5. **Once you are happy with the summary** mark the message with the summary with a :white_check_mark:âœ… emoji reaction.

Repeat as many times as you want! Make a new `/chat` for each new paper. 

### NOTE - 
- AI gets things wrong all the time! Be mindful! Its a tool, not an oracle!

- The bot (currently) cannot see your other chats, so you should remind it what you are thinking about for your project (Go into your `Introdutions` chat and say "Summarize this conversation"  (or something similar) and then copy-paste the reuslts into the new chat!)

- Usually best not to ask the bot for *specific* things (like "tell me a researcher studying this?" or "what are some papers on this topic?" - Better to ask more general questions like "what should I search for on PubMed/Google Scholar to find more info on this topic?"

- Keep track of the papers you discussed with bot using Zotero (or any other method) 

Have fun!
