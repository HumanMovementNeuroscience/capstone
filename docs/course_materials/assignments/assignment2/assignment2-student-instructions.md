# Assignment 2 (preview) 

### 1. Go into the #2-paper-summary, pop open a `/chat` and talk to the bot about some paper or another on any topic that you are interested in (i.e. roughly related to your hypothetical capstone topic)

### 2. Be sure to copy-paste  the **full citation**  in the chat somewhere. You can also copy-paste the paper abstract as well to kickstart things. 

### 3. Once you've had a bit of a chat about it, copy the prompt I put in the top of that channel into your chat and see what it produces (Tweak the prompt as needed to get the results you want!) 

Do this as many times as you want - make a new `/chat` for each new paper. 

### NOTE - 

- The bot (currently) cannot see your other chats, so you should remind it what you are thinking about for your project (Go into your <#1196583352736677958> chat and say "Summarize this conversation" to make that easier!)

- AI gets things wrong all the time! Be mindful!

- Usually best not to ask the bot for *specific* things (like "tell me a researcher studying this?" or "what are some papers on this topic?" - Better to ask more general questions like "what should I search for on PubMed/Google Scholar to find more info on this topic?"

- Keep track of the papers you discussed with bot using Zotero (or any other method) 

Have fun!
