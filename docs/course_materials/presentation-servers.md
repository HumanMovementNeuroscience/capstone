# Capstone Presentation Servers

- Assign each student to be a `Mod` in `3` 'Topic Servers' based on overlapping interests
- Task is to set up the server with skellybot categories and channels to present their capstone topic to others

Each server will include: 
- A category housing the `capstone` channel for each ``Mod` student
  - These channels will redundant across multiple servers!
    -  will be copied from the class server channel into each of the `3` topic Servers
  - the `category` prompt will contain a terse-summary of all `3` capstone topics
- AT LEAST one additional category that contains AT LEAST `3` channels for `overlap-topics` between the capstone topics
- a `Start Here` channel where peeps can pop in and ask the bot to orient them to the server


## Peer evaluation

Each student will also be assigned to go take a tour through (at least) `3` other servers and: 
    - Have a `/chat` in the `START HERE` channel
    - Have (at least) `3` `/chat`'s anywhere else in the server
  
If the 'evaluating' student thinks the server is well designed to present the capstone topic, they will give the server a `thumbs-up` reaction

## Carrot
I will grant `invite` permissions to the `Mods` of any server that accrues `2` `thumbs-up` reactions 
    - That is, if the server passes peer review, the ``Mod`'s will be allow to 'publish' it (i.e. invite the general public to join and learn from the server they built)
