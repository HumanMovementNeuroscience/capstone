# Capstone Course: Knowledge Tree Outline Assignment

## Introduction

In this assignment, you will construct a 'Knowledge Tree' to organize and structure the various components of your capstone project. This exercise will serve as a foundation for your research, helping you to categorize your thoughts and sources in a clear, hierarchical manner. It's designed to not only aid in your understanding of the topic but also to facilitate effective communication of your findings.

## Pre-Exercise Preparation
- **Select a Markdown Editor**: Choose from VS Code, ObsidianMD, HackMD, or use `docx` via Google Docs or MS Word (later converting to markdown).
  - if you need assistance using or choosing a tool to use for this assignment, please ask for help in the appropriate channel in the `Tools` category.
- **Set Up Citation Management**: Make sure you have a Zotero account or an equivalent tool ready for managing your citations.
  - if you need help with this, please ask for help in the `#zotero` channel in the `Tools` category.

## Step-by-Step Guide
1. **Create an Outline**: Draft a high-level outline of your capstone project in the markdown file.
2. **Structure Your Knowledge Tree**: Organize your outline using a 3^3 approach:
   - **3 Main Topics**: Summarize each in less than one sentence.
   - **3 Subtopics Each**: Define subtopics for each main point in roughly one sentence.
   - **3 Citations Each**: Find and summarize 3 sources per subtopic, each with a 1-2 sentence summary.
3. **Citation Logging**: Record all citations in your chosen citation management tool.

## Assignment Goals
- A markdown document with a structured 3^3 topic tree of your capstone project.
- Each main topic should have 3 subtopics, and each subtopic should have 3 citations with summaries.
- All citations should be logged and organized within your citation management tool.

## Reflection and Philosophical Underpinnings
- Reflect on the process of creating your knowledge tree and how it represents the 'web of belief' that underpins your research.
  - If you want to know more, check out [W.V.O. Quine's "Web of Belief"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_belief) (and/or ask the bot about), esp Hilary Putnam's take on it.
- Consider how this structure can potentially evolve as your understanding deepens and your project progresses.

## Definition of "Done"
You will know when you are done with this assignment when you have completed the following:
- A markdown document with a structured 3^3 topic tree of your capstone project.
  - Each main topic should have 3 subtopics, and each subtopic should have 3 citations with summaries.
- You have (at least) 27 citations logged and organized within your citation management tool.
