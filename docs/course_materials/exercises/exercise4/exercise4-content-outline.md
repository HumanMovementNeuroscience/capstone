# Exercise 4 - Building your tree ðŸŒ±

## Overview
This exercise is designed to help you start structuring the knowledge base for your capstone project. You will create a preliminary outline using a markdown file, which will evolve into a more detailed tree of knowledge.

## Part A: Course Dev update
- Discuss the Discord as a  collaborative text editor / data collection tool 
- Show examples from previous iterations of this class

## Part B: Course Development and Tools

## Part C: Philosophical Underpinnings
- Delve into the concept of a 'web of belief' and its relevance to your research.
- Relate this to the creation of a knowledge tree, which will form the backbone of your capstone project.

## Part D: Drafting Your Capstone Outline
- Start with a single markdown page to outline your project.
- Use a 3x3 structure to organize your topics and subtopics.
  - 3 main topics
  - 3 minor topics (per main)
  - 3 citations per minor topic
 - (and like, your own 'discusion' section, as appropriate)
  
## Part E: Assignments and Interim Exercises
- Detail the specific tasks for this exercise.
- Clarify the expectations and how your work will be evaluated.
- Encourage consistent engagement with the course material through these exercises.

## Conclusion
- Wrap up the document with a call to action.
- Motivate students to actively construct their knowledge tree, which will serve as the foundation for their capstone project.
