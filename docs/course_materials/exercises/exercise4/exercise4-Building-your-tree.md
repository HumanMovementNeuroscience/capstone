## Pre-Exercise Preparation
- Choose your preferred tool for creating a markdown document: VS Code, ObsidianMD, HackMD, or `docx` via Google Docs or MS Word (with conversion to markdown).
- Ensure you have a Zotero account or a similar tool for managing your citations.

## Step-by-Step Guide
1. Create a high-level outline of your capstone project using a markdown file.
2. Organize your topics and subtopics using a 3x3 structure:
   - Identify 3 main topics (less than one sentence each).
   - Define 3 minor topics for each main point (roughly 1 sentence each).
   - Find and cite 3 sources per minor topic, providing a 1-2 sentence summary for each citation.
3. Log all citations in your citation management tool (e.g., Zotero).
