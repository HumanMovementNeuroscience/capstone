Prof self-evaluation

This is a decent first pass at an exercise, its a decent start, but its too vague. 

Want to update it to match the perscribed schema and add more details. 

In short, I will ask them to: 

- simplify the bot-prompt thing so their whole capstone is outline in a single message in the `bot prompt` section of their category (show an example in the server)

- specify that they only *need* to make channels for the 3 main topics, but they can make channels for the subtopics if they want
  - format it so that the #channel-name in th emessage also links to the channel

- also set up `general` channel, and `paper-summarize` channel with the paper schema included in it. 

tasks I will ask them to do - 

- pop a /chat in each of the 3 main topic channels

- use the #papers channel to discuss individual papers and then show them how to extract a summary and then use it to drive forward a dicsussion in one of the topic channels.
