~~ # Video 2 - Building your workspace ~~

## Part A - Course prep check in 
- Its hard to teach a class in how to write a grant proposal or whatever when the fundamental tools that I use to do that changed dramatically recently 
- so, like, I'm trying to teach you how to do something that I am currently figuring out how to do myself. 
### My plans
- short (next week)
- medium (As ASAP as Possible)
- long (Before the end of the semester)
### Course Materials
- updates to the syllabus
- added `#important links` channel
- give some info about the expectations for the capstone project
  - Especially w.r.t.
    - citation stuff
    - the actual document guidelines
- Talk about the general timelines expected (in the syllabus)
- Also do the FreeMoCap disclosure thing explicitly

## Part B - Responsive Instructions
- Lots of short chats are better than a couple long ones 
  - or at least, they are different and serve different purposes
- Mention the "giving the bot the citation and then asking about the paper content" thing
- Mention the new capacties
  - Trigger chat from message 
    - right click, select APP >> 'create /chat from message'
  - Bot can handle text attachements to message (but NOT PDFs or images)
  - Recommend using Voice memos for brain dumps
