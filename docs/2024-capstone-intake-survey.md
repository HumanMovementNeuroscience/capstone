## Data Usage and Privacy
### Data Usage and Privacy Disclosure
#### The course Discord server
- The Discord server will be private and will only consist of myself, members of the course, and a few professor friends who I've invited to observe and participate (they will be tagged with the "Observer" role).
#### The course GitHub repository
  - Your GitHub repository will be public by default, if you want to make it private, you can do so, but managing this setting is your responsibility.
  - Please note that your Discord text/username may appear on video streams. Choose your Server name/settings with this in mind.
  - Any information hosted publicly will be de-identified to the best of our ability, using the information you provide. Your data will be tagged using the 6-digit hex code you choose in the next section.
- If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact me. Reasonable accommodations can be made. However, please note that these accommodations may involve excluding you from the data collection/analysis process, which is a part of the course curriculum.
### Identifing Information
List all of your potentially identifying names/nicknames in a comma separated list.

I will use this list to remove any times that the bot may have referred to you by name.

Best to be exhaustive, even if it is unlikely that a particular name came up in conversation.

e.g. my full name is Jonathan Samir Matthis, but I often go by "Jon" so I would respond with:


- `Jonathan, Samir, Matthis, Jon` (correct!)

Do not include any other text in your response, e.g. 

NO: 
- `My name is Jonathan, but I go by Jon. people call` (incorrect!)

### Anonymous ID
Choose an anonymous ID based on a 6-digit color hex code:
1. Go to this site (or equivalent) https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/
2. Pick your favorite color
3. Copy the 6-digit hexadecimal code on the top of the column to the right
4. Paste the ID as your answer to this question.
- [Your 6-digit Hex ID]

### Consent for Future Use of Data

At the moment, this course (and any associated data) is not associated with any research project, but we might want to use it for research in the future (e.g. to examine it as an example method for using AI as a teaching tool).
