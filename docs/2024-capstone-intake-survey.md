## Data Usage and Privacy
### Data useage and privacy disclosure
- Clarity on how their data will be used
  - Discord will be private, except for professor friends I've invited to watch and participate (tagged with "Observer" role)
  - GitHub will be public by default
    - You can make it private if you want, but that complexity is on you 
  - Your Discord text/username may be visible on video streams, choose your Server name/settings accordingly
  - Anything hosted publically will be best-effort-de-identified  using the information they share
    - Data will be tagged using the 6-digit hex code they choose below
- They can contact me with questions or concerns and reasonable accomodations will be made
  - but also, that'll most involve me excluding them from the data collection/analysis process, so they will miss out on that part of the course

### Identifing Information
List all of your potentially identifying names/nicknames in a comma separated list.

I will use this list to remove any times that the bot may have referred to you by name.

Best to be exhaustive, even if it is unlikely that a particular name came up in conversation.

e.g. my full name is Jonathan Samir Matthis, but I often go by "Jon" so I would respond with:


- `Jonathan, Samir, Matthis, Jon` (correct!)

Do not include any other text in your response, e.g. 

NO: 
- `My name is Jonathan, but I go by Jon. people call` (incorrect!)

### Anonymous ID
Choose an anonymous ID based on a 6-digit color hex code:
1. Go to this site (or equivalent) https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/
2. Pick your favorite color
3. Copy the 6-digit hexadecimal code on the top of the column to the right
4. Paste the ID as your answer to this question.
- [Your 6-digit Hex ID]

### Consent for Future Use of Data

At the moment, this course (and any associated data) is not associated with any research project, but we might want to use it for research in the future (e.g. to examine it as an example method for using AI as a teaching tool). 
Do you consent to having your de-identified data  form this course used for research/education (or similar) purposes in the future?
