## Data Usage and Privacy
### Disclosure
- Clarity on how their data will be used
- they can contact me with questions or concerns

### Identifing Information
List all of your potentially identifying names/nicknames.

I will use this list to remove any times that the bot may have referred to you by name.

Best to be exhaustive, even if it is unlikely that a particular name came up in conversation.

e.g. my full name is Jonathan Samir Matthis, but I often go by "Jon" so I would respond with:

`Jonathan Samir Matthis Jon`

- Full Name: [Your Full Name]
- Nicknames: [Any nicknames or aliases you go by]
